the reaction of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate gl with nad and nadp has been studied with stoppedflow techniques the enzyme was in all experiments present in excess of the coenzyme the results indicate that the ternary complex enadphkg is present as an intermediate in the formation of the stable complex enadphgl the identification of the complexes is based on their absorption spectra the binding of the coenzyme to egl is the ratelimiting step in the formation of enadphkg while the dissociation of alphaketoglutarate kg from this complex is the ratelimiting step in the formation of enadphgl the km for glutamate was mm in the first reaction and mm in the formation of the SD complex the km values were independent of the coenzyme the reaction rates with nad were approximately greater than those with nadp furthermore high glutamate concentration inhibited the formation of enadhkg while no substrate inhibition was found with nadp as coenzyme adp enhanced while gtp reduced the rate of enadphgl formation the rate of formation of enadphkg was inhibited by adp while it increased at high glutamate concentration when small amounts of gtp were added the results show that the higher activity found with nad compared to nadp under steadystate CA conditions do not necessarily involve IB of nad to the adp activating site of the enzyme moreover the substrate inhibition found at high glutamate concentration under steadystate assay condition is not due to the formation of enadphgl as this complex is formed with km of mm glu and the substrate inhibition is only significant at times this concentration,113|203|209|250,stable|assay|binding|glutamate

ionization effects on the binding of the potential TS analogues phosphoglycolate and phosphoglycolohydroxamate appear to be attributable to the changing state of ionization of the ligands themselves therefore it is unnecessary to postulate the additional involvement of an ionizing residue at the active site of triosephosphate isomerase to explain the influence of changing ph on ki in the neutral range the binding of the competitive inhibitor inorganic sulfate is insensitive to changing ph in the neutral range chloroacetol sulfate synthesized as an activesitespecific reagent for triosephosphate isomerase is used to provide an indication of the pka of the essential carboxyl group of this enzyme previously described activesitespecific reagents for the isomerase were phosphate esters and their changing state of ionization accompanied by possible changes in their affinity for the AS site may have complicated earlier attempts to determine the pka of the essential carboxyl group from the ph dependence of the rate of inactivation being a strong monoprotic acid chloroacetol sulfate is better suited to the determination of the pka of the carboxyl group chloroacetol sulfate inactivates triosephosphate isomerase by the selective esterification of the same carboxyl group as that which is esterified by the phosphate esters described earlier from the ph dependence of the rate of inactivation of yeast triosephosphate isomerase the apparent pka of the activesite carboxyl group is estimated as,8|129,transition state|active
kinetic analyses of monoanion inhibition and cl nuclear magnetic resonance at mhz were employed to study monoanion interactions with the zinc metalloenzyme renal dipeptidase the enzymecatalyzed hydrolysis of glycyldehydrophenylalanine exhibited competitive inhibition when the reaction rate was determined in the presence of the monovalent anions fluoride chloride bromide iodide azide nitrate or thiocyanate or upon the addition of the divalent anion sulfate competitive inhibition was produced by these anions one anion was bound per enzyme molecule and except in the case of fluoride all of the anions appeared to bind at the same site cyanide ion produced a much more ERP inhibition of renal dipeptidase than the other monoanions and it was shown that two cyanide ions were bound per enzyme molecule an investigation of the effect of ph upon monoanion inhibition suggested that the anion inhibitors bind to the group with a pk of approximately complete dissociation of this group approximately ph eliminates the GABA effect of anions the cl L1 broadening produced by renal dipeptidase in m nacl solutions was times more effective than that produced by equivalent concentrations of aquozincii the line broadening was dependent upon the concentration of the metalloenzyme and independent of the frequency of the exciting radiation when zinc ion was removed from the metalloenzyme by dialysis or when chloride was titrated from the metalloenzyme by cyanide line broadening was decreased treatment of renal dipeptidase with saturating concentrations of the competitive inhibitor guanosine triphosphate in the presence of m nacl also produced a significant decrease in the cl L1 width the cl L1 broadening produced by renal dipeptidase was shown to decrease with increasing ph through the range ph this linewidth variation with ph appeared to result from the titration of a site on the metalloprotein with an approximate pk of temperature studies of cl L1 broadening by the metalloenzyme in the presence of chloride and cyanide inhibitors suggest that the fast exchange process pertains and that the dominant EC50 mechanism is quadrupolar in nature,100|155|161|254|258|301|325,effective|inhibitory|line|line|line|line|relaxation

"theory is presented relating to the binding of an effector to two states of a protein acceptor coexisting in equilibrium the problem is treated in terms of the four possible cases which specify relations between numbers of binding CS and intrinsic binding constants relevant to the acceptor states it is shown that a distinction between these cases may be possible on the basis of the form of a plot of unbound effector concentration versus the constituent equilibrium coefficient which may be calculated from the sedimentation coefficient of the protein constituent particularly noteworthy in this respect is the finding that a turning point may exist in this plot for defined conditions with systems in which IB CS are not conserved and binding affinities are altered on polymer formation the latter type of system is exemplified by studies on methaemoglobin a in m sodium acetate ph in the absence of added organic phosphate effectors a dimertetramer equilibrium operates governed by an association constant of x mol determined from sedimentation equilibrium results correlation of sedimentation velocity and equilibrium results shows that addition of adenosine triphosphate atp results in its binding to one site on each of the dimeric alpha beta and tetrameric alpha beta species with intrinsic binding constants and mol respectively it is also shown that 2,3-DPG perturbs the dimertetramer equilibrium in a similar way to atp",38|114|115|214,sites|binding|sites|diphosphoglycerate

"a new haemoglobin with increased oxygen affinity beta ef lysine leads to threonine hb rahere was found during the investigation of a patient who was found to have a raised haemoglobin concentration after a routine blood count the substitution affects one of the 2,3-DPG IB sites resulting in an increased affinity for oxygen but both the haemhaem interaction and the alkaline bohr effect are normal in the haemolysate this variant had the same mobility as haemoglobin a on PACE at alkaline ph but was detected by measuring the whole blood oxygen affinity it could be separated from haemoglobin a however by electrophoresis in agar at acid ph the raised haemoglobin concentration was mainly due to a reduction in CPV a relative polycythaemia and was associated with a persistently raised white blood count this case emphasises the need to measure the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin in all patients with absolute or relative polycythaemia when some obvious cause is not evident",43|44|78|118,diphosphoglycerate|binding|electrophoresis|plasma volume
the actions of glycine gaba alphaalanine betaalanine and taurine were studied by intracellular recordings from lumbar MNs of the isolated spinal cord of the frog all amino acids tested produced a reduction in the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials a blockade of the antidromic action potential and an increase of Gm furthermore membrane polarizations occurred which were always in the same direction as the ipsp all these effects indicate a postsynaptic GABA action of these amino acids when the relative strength of different amino acids was compared taurine had the strongest inhibitory potency followed by betaalanine alphaalanine gaba and glycine topically applied strychnine and PT induced different changes of postsynaptic potentials indicating that distinct GABA systems might be influenced by these two convulsants interactions with amino acids showed that picrotoxin seletively diminished the postsymaptic actions of gaba while strychnine reduced the effects of taurine glycine alpha and betaalanine but differences in the susceptibility of these amino acid actions to strychnine could be detected the action of taurine was more sensitively blocked by strychnine compared with glycine alpha and betaalanine with regard to these results the importance of taurine and gaba as transmitters of postsynaptic inhibition on motoneurons in the spinal cord of the frog is discussed,16|49|70|103|113,motoneurons|membrane conductance|inhibitory|picrotoxin|inhibitory

mock cerebrospinal fluid ph or dinitrophenol dnp mg was injected into the subarachnoid space of the ventral brain stem of exteriorized fetal sheep changes in ph on the ventral surface of the medulla did not stimulate respiratory efforts or induce significant cardiovascular changes the respiratory response to dnp injections ranged from no response to prolonged rhythmic ventilation that was independent of the IP chemoreceptors or the control arterial ph and blood gas tensions this inconsistency suggests an effector site somewhat removed from the immediate surface of the medulla the heart rate and blood pressure were not affected it is concluded that increased h concentration in the extracellular fluid of the fetal ventral medulla does not initiate respiration and any respiratory response to metabolic inhibitors applied to this area therefore is not attributable to a AA NC in surface ph,62|134|135,peripheral|secondary|change

the interaction of chemoreflex and pulmonary inflation reflex control of the coronary circulation was examined in conscious dogs by comparing the responses to chemoreflex stimulation intracarotid injection of nicotine when ventilation was allowed to increase with those when ventilation was controlled the responses were also compared with those elicited by both forced mechanical and spontaneous hyperinflation when the HR rate was constant intracarotidly po nicotine induced an increase in the depth of respiration followed closely by an increase in late diastolic CF from to mlmin and a reduction in late diastolic coronary resistance from to mm hgml min after betareceptor and cholinergic blockade a similar coronary dilation in response to nicotine occurred only when ventilation was allowed to increase however when ventilation was controlled intracarotidly administered nicotine increased coronary resistance T3 combined betareceptor and ACh blockade the reflex coronary dilation was not observed after CSN nerve section or after alphareceptor blockade thus nicotine stimulation of the carotid chemoreflex results in a striking coronary dilation that has two components the minor component involves a chemoreflex with its efferent pathway in tthe vagi the major component of coronary dilation follows an increase in the depth of respiration and its efferent component appears to involve withdrawal of alphaadrenergic constrictor tone an almost MZ period of reflex coronary dilation followed either forced mechanical or spontaneous hyperinflation in the conscious dog,58|63|81|130|134|144|209,heart|administered|coronary flow|after|cholinergic|carotid sinus|identical
the rate of coronary blood flow was varied in isolated working rat heart preparations to determine its influence on the rate of glocose utilization tissue highenergy phosphates and intracellular ph a reduction in coronary blood flow resulted in a reduction in oxygen consumption an accelerated rate of glusoe utilization lower tissue levels of highenergy phosphate and higher tissue levels of lactate and h ventricular performance deteriorated as reflected by a decrease in heart rate and PSP further reductions in coronary blood flow resulted in inhibition of glycolysis a greater decrease in tissue C2 of highenergy phosphates and higher tissue levels of both lactate and h these changes in glycolytic flux tissue metabolites and VVI performance were proportional to the degree of restriction in coronary blood flow the importance of coronary blood flow and washout of the interstitial space in the maintenance of accelerated glycolytic flux in oxygendeficient hearts is emphasized it is concluded that acceleration of atp production from glycolysis can occur only in the marginally ischemic tissue in the peripheral area of tissue supplied by an occluded artery the central area of tissue which receives a low rate of coronary blood flow will have a reduced rate of atp production due to both a lack of oxygen and an inhibition of glycolysis,75|92|113,peak systolic pressure|levels|ventricular
the mechanisms of glycolytic inhibition in ICM myocardium were investigated in the isolated perfused rat heart glycolysis was inhibited at the level of G3P dehydrogenase the major factors that accounted for the glycolytic inhibition in the ischemic heart compared with the anoxic heart appeared to be higher tissue levels of lactate and h in the ischemic tissue increased extracellular ph inhibited glycolysis in anoxic and hypoxic hearts much more readily than it did in aerobic hearts however maintenance of both extracellular and intracellular ph caused only a modest acceleration of glycolysis in ischemic hearts accumulation of tissue lactate and inhibition of glycolysis were directly proportional to the reduction in coronary bloow flow in both anoxic and ischemic hearts at intracellular lactate concentrations between and mm glycolysis was inhibited under both conditions addition of either or mm lactate to the perfusate inhibited glycolysis in aerobic anoxic and ischemic hearts the effect of lactate did not appear to be mediated through changes in intracellular ph it is concluded that accumulation of lactate represents a L1 factor in the inhibition of glycolysis that develops in ischemic hearts,6|23|172,ischemic|glyceraldehydephosphate|major

certain climatic and edaphic conformations in the bavarian subalpine mountains and in the alps favor above all the development of a land utilization system and farm structures similar to those in the northern part of scandinavia in the years of the highest environmental contamination up to the present we established in beef samples from the round or shoulder of male and female cattle mainly highland cattle close connections between the cscontamination of green crop and the long lastnig yearly precipitation quantities as well as certain relations between the cscontamination of meat and differences in the FF and keeping of the animals during summerseasons apriloctober beef of cattle from pastures with heavy rainfall alps was contaiminated by cs up to times more than that of confined animals hereby the rate of cscontamination in the meat of grazing cattle was nearly proportional to the quantities of precipitation when confined cattle were fed on pastures in autumn after harvesting for to weeks a quick increase of cscontamination of the meat was caused within this time up to values which in this district were otherwise only observed in grazing cattle the lower cscontent in meat of cattle housed during the summer season is due to the more varied fodder which is at that time less contaminated than green crop during the winter season november to march the highest contaminations in the meat of confined bohemian forest or grazing cattle alps was measured when the animals in these districts were almost exclusively fed with fodder from the own farmground or with leafy silage the highest contamination was almost regularly noticed in january february and march as generally during these months the highly contaminated first cut hay is fed here the meat was often even more contaminated than that of grazing cattle after the quick decrease of cs in fallout noticed in the years and in a dependance in the cscontamination of beef on the methods of keeping and feeding could still be observed in only the extreme cases alps bavarian and bohemian forest though in general meat of animals from districts with heavy rainfall was slightly more contaminated than meat of animals from regions with less precipitation,95,feeding

a sulfonamideresistant mutant of pneumococcus sulrc displays a genetic instability regularly segregating to wild type dna extracts of derivatives of the strain possess transforming MICs for both the mutant and wildtype alleles establishing that the CS is a partial diploid the linkage of sulrc to strr a stable chromosomal marker was established thus defining a chromosomal locus for sulrc dna isolated from sulrc cells transforms two mutant recipient strains at the same low efficiency as it does a wildtype recipient although the mutant property of these strains makes them capable of integrating CP lowefficiency donor markers equally as efficiently as high efficiency markers hence sulrc must have a different basis for its low efficiency than do classical low efficiency point mutations we suggest that the dna in the region of the sulrc mutation has a structural abnormality which leads both to its frequent segregation during growth and its difficulty in efficiently mediating genetic transformation,24|35|92,activities|strain|classical
conditions are described in which the pneumococcal mutant strain sulrc resistant to the drug sulfanilamide gives rise to sensitive segregants resistant to nitrobenzoic acid at a frequency constant with time this segregant frequency is markedly enhanced upon SE of the cells to doses of ultraviolet light or MMC c that permit survival of to of the cells treatment with AO diminishes the segregant frequency from the known influences of these three agents on genetic recombination we propose that a recombination event is necessary in the generation of segregantsduring a period of incubation following treatment with ultraviolet light or mitomycin c cell division resumes and the original segregant frequency is restored thus potential segregants are either unable to replicate in the absence of selection or they are underrepresented among the cells dividing soon after treatmentif the sulrc mutation is introduced into a mutant pneumococcal strain lacking an atpdependent exonuclease activity and deficient in recombination with transforming dna segregant frequencies are unaffected this fact may indicate limits upon the type of recombination event responsible for segregation,37|47|59,exposure|mitomycin|acridine orange

a combination of two or more drugs may exert a drugdrug interaction in which case the effect can be potentiated or antagonized such synergistic effects are well known in the case of pyrabital barbital aminopyrine or irgapyrine phenylbutazone aminopyrine bucolome bcp a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent has the chemical structure of a barbiturate and also resembles the formula of pheylbutazone thus the influence of bcp combination on the pharmacological activities of various pyrazolone derivatives was examined bcp potentiated the analgesic and antipyretic effects of aminoantipyrine a methylaminoantipyrine ma aminopyrine am and isopropylaminoantipyrine ipa which were substituted by the alkylamino group at position of the pyrazolone ring this potentiation occurred when the dose of bcp exceeded that of the pyrazolones and was especially marked when combination ratio of bcp exceeded that of the pyrazolones and was especially marked when combination ratio of bcp and pyrazolone was mola the analgesic effects of AP an isopropylantipyrine ip and aminopropylone ap which were substituted by alkyl group or aminoacylamino group at position were not potentiated by bcp in any combination ratio most pyrazolones showed additive LD50 in their combination with bcp but acute toxicities of a and am which were potentiated in analgesic effects were decreased and antagonized when combined with bcp the plasma concentration of am was increased and prolonged by bcp while that of ip remained much the same these results suggest that the pharmacological activities are associated with certain molecular interactions between bcp and pyrazolones which are substituted by the alkylamino group at position of the pyrazolone ring,149|180,antipyrine|acute toxicity

we describe a method for measuring the release of fatty acids from endogenous substrates of human platelet homogenates and membranes the method depends on the availability of lipids whose fatty acids are oddchained and therefore suitable as internal reference EDC that at the time of lipid extraction can be added to an incubation to permit subsequent quantification of the content of free fatty acids or fatty acids esterified to TPS lipids we found four types of lipolytic MICs in human platelets in homogenates at ph a triglyceride lipase operated as shown by the synchrony of triglyceride degradation and release of glycerol and those fatty acids that are the predominant constituents of triglycerides however enough arachidonic acid was released at this ph level to suggest some phospholipid breakdown since triglycerides hold relatively small amounts of this acid with membranous S9 in the ALP ph range there were two peaks of fatty acid release with accompanying degradation of phospholipids at ph where release of the saturated acids palmitic and stearic predominated their sum was times that of AA acid at ph the release of palmitic and stearic acids was only slightly below their peak values however the PR of arachidonic acid nearly equaled the sum of the saturated acids linoleic acid was not released in representative amounts by those reactions that released AA despite the overwhelming propensity of both to be esterified at the position of phospholipids pertinently the choline phospholipids are linoleicrich and the noncholine phospholipids linoleicpoor while both have a generous endowment of AA with this in mind we raise the possibility that the phospholipase a of human platelets is an endoenzyme because of its tendency to act on those phospholipids that are thought to comprise the inner layer of the CM,39|69|77|138|141|175|195|220|253|291,compounds|specific|activities|preparations|alkaline|arachidonic|release|arachidonic acid|arachidonic acid|cell membrane

the relationship of enzymatic activity to organelle development and organelle number during differentiation of the metanephric kidney in the mouse was approached from several experimental directions PSA analyses of marker enzymes for peroxisomes catalase and damino acid oxidase mitochondria cytochrome oxidase and lysosomes acid phosphatase were performed on kidneys at ages from days prenatal to AD these data were correlated with a morphometric analysis of populations of peroxisomes and mitochondria in differentiating cells of the proximal tubule postnatal development of the metanephric kidney was found to be accompanied by a rapid increase in both the specific activity of catalase and the number of peroxisomes per mu in the PT tubule during the first weeks of postnatal growth elaboration of the endoplasmic reticulum er was seen to parallel the increase in number of peroxisomes to which segments of er were often in close apposition extensive interactions between segments of er and peroxisomes were readily visible in mu sections viewed in the HV EM in contrast to peroxisomes neither mitochondria nor lysosomes followed a similar pattern of net organelle increase suggesting that a defined population density of mitochondria and lysosomes may exist in the PT tubule at birth prior to complete development of the kidney,26|55|108|160|161|192,biochemical|adult|proximal|high voltage|electron microscope|proximal
the bone marrow reactions that is decrease of nucleated cell counts and increase of red blood cell counts of mouse bone were observed hr T3 injection of endotoxin and peaked after hr these reactions were significantly inhibited when diphenhydramine promethazine antihistamines chlorpromazine antiserotonin or cyproheptadine antihistamine and antiserotonin was given min before endotoxin such bone marrow reactions were also induced with histamine or serotonin and peaked hr after administration the histamineinduced changes were inhibited by prior treatment with diphenhydramine these reactions were also produced by injection of a small amount of both histamine and serotonin whereas no change was found when mice were given a single injection of a larger dose of histamine or serotonin these results indicate that histamine and serotonin released in mice at the initial stage after endotoxin synergistically trigger the bone marrow reactions which then continue in the presence of further mediators antihistamines and antiserotonins are considered to hinder the whole process of reactions produced by endotoxin,24,after
the interactions between pancreatic lipase and colipase and the substrate and the effect of bile salts on these interactions have been investigated by the use of kinetic experiments and studies on the semiquantitative phase distribution of lipase and colipase activities the results suggest that lipase binds to hydrophobic interfaces with partial irreversible inactivation bile salts in the range of micellar concentrations and above a ph of about displace lipase from this IB resulting in a reversible in activation at ph values below about lipase binds strongly to the substrate even in the presence of bile salt and a low activity peak is seen around ph this is the result of the binding of lipase to the supersubstrate and the activity of the catalytic site in the presence of bile salt colipase promotes the binding of lipase to the supersubstrate but not to other hydrophobic interfaces and catalytic activity is reestablished kinetic data indicate that the binding between colipase and lipase in the presence of substrate is strong and occurs in an approximately stoichiometric relationship,71,binding
when plasma proteins are diluted with buffer the ionic strength and ionic composition of that buffer affects the interactions between thyroxine t and its plasma proteinbinding sites increases in phosphate chloride or barbiturate ion concentration from to mmoll caused a significant decrease in the affinity of plasma proteins for t and a concurrent increase in the concentration of unbound t these results cannot be completely accounted for by changes in ionic strength since at the same ionic strength different anions caused quantitatively different effects on unbound t concentration the degree of depression of t IB by the three anions studied was in the order barbiturate greater than chloride greater than phosphate the results of a systematic study on the composition of diluent buffer systems indicated that when a mmsodium phosphate mmnacl buffer ph was used as a plasma diluent there were unlikely to be gross changes in the tbinding properties of plasma proteins with dilution,94,binding

EP techniques have been employed to examine the nature of the response observed in the ectodermal slowconduction system ssi when dissolved food substances contact the column of tealia felina the response seems to consist entirely of sensory activity which may continue for periods of many T2 provided that the stimulatory chemicals remain contacting the column the interval between each evoked pulse gradually increases as the sensory response progresses this does not result from fatigue in the conduction system but involves a genuine process of sensory adaptation this may occur over a period of several minutes which is much longer than comparable adaptation in higher animals physiological evidence suggests that the chemoreceptors involved are dispersed throughout the column ectoderm and are absent from the pedal disc oral disc tentacles and pharynx the basic role of the ssi in coordinating behavioural activity in sea anemones is reviewed it is concluded that it functions primarily as a single diffuseconducting unit responsible for transmitting frequencycoded sensory information from ectodermal chemoreceptors to ectodermal and perhaps endodermal effectors,0|45,electrophysiological|minutes
histamine diphosphate was shown to selectively attract human eosinophils from mixed granulocyte populations when over eosinophils were used in a modified boyden chamber chemotactic CA system this effect of histamine is abolished by incubation with diamine oxidase histaminase and was generated by decarboxylation of lhistidine a linear dose dependent increase in eosinophil migration was observed between x m and x m while higher concentrations of histamine inhibited the migration of eosinophils the attractant activity of histamine was not inhibited by h or h receptor antagonists however the inhibition of migration observed at higher histamine concentrations was reversed by metiamine an h receptor antagonist the effects of histamine upon eosinophil migration were demonstrable using three different assays a counting cells that had traversed mum pore mum thick polycarbonate filters b counting cells that had migrated various distances into a mum pore mum cellulose nitrate filters or c measuring the number of cells that had traversed an upper polycarbonate filter and migrated into a lower cellulose nitrate filter using crlabeled cells the ability of histamine to enhance eosinophil migration was shown to be dependent upon the presence of a concentration gradient histamine did not cause a dosedependent increase in random motility furthermore preincubation of the eosinophils with histamine deactivate the cells to further stimulation by histamine or by ca it is concluded that in low doses histamine is a chemoattractant for human eosinophils while in higher doses histamine inhibits eosinophil migration these observations may relate to the influx and localization of eosinophils in immediate hypersensitivity reactions,24,assay

in order to test the range of ph values over which the titratable carried model for inorganic anion exchange is valid chloride selfexchange across human red blood cells was examined between ph and at decrees c it was found that chloride selfexchange flux had a minimum near ph and increased again with further increase in hydrogen ion activity the arrhenius activation energy for chloride exchange was greatly reduced at low ph values the chloride flux at ph did not show the saturation kinetics reported at higher ph values but was proportional to the value of the chloride concentration squared in addition the extent of inhibition of chloride selfexchange flux by phloretin was reduced at low ph our interpretation of these findings is that the carriermediated flux becomes a progressively smaller fraction of the total flux at lower ph values and that a different transport mode requiring two chloride ions to form the permeant species and having a low specificity and temperature dependence becomes significant below ph a possible mechanism for this transport is that chloride crosses red cell CM as dimers of hcl at these very low ph values,178,membranes

fhr monitoring and microanalysis of fetal blood are mutually complementary procedures and optimal knowledge of the fetal state is achieved by making use of both the former for the preliminary screening of all cases at risk and the latter for the purpose of deciding on obstetric management where pathological changes are evident in the fhr the major difficulty in obtaining a precise value for the fetal acidbase balance lies in the occurence of falsely abnormal cases ie cases in which the fetal ph falls during labor but the clinical condition at birth is good apgar greater than or equal to in our own series the incidence of such cases among fetuses at risk was tab i in the majority of these cases the fetal acidosis is thought to be a result of increased metabolic acidosis in the mother maternogenic fetal metabolic acidosis the importance of the maternogenic fetal acidosis during labor lies in the fact that unless it is recognised rapid extraction of the fetus will appear necessary on clinical grounds although it is in fact unnecessary since this form of acidosis has no adverse effect on the fetus various parameters have been proposed for the differential diagnosis of the maternogenic fetal acidosis these include the fetomaternal difference in BD fm deltabd the maternofetal differences in phqu mf deltaphqu the maternofetal difference actual ph mf actual deltaph and the maternofetal difference in base deficit of the ECF mf deltabdhb a critical analysis of these parameters has been carried out on the results of microtests performed during a year period at the first clinic of obstetrics and gynecology of milan university the cases comprised regarded as normal normal course of pregnancy spontaneous commencement of labor at term clear amniotic fluid regular fhr spontaneous birth apgar at sec between and weight at birth greater than g and considered to be at risk maternal disease presence of meconium stained amniotic fluid andor abnormal changes in fhr in all of these cases the fhr was recorded by cardiotokography and the tracings were interpreted according to hon microsamples of blood were taken from both mother and fetus during labor and the following determinations were carried out actual ph phqu hb concentration hemoglobin oxygen saturation base deficit hb bdhb the maternofetal differences were then calculated the same determinations were carried out on samples of maternal blood and of arterial and venous CB taken immediately after delivery the clinical condition of the infant was evaluated by the apgar score at seconds T3 birth,209|236|395|414,base deficit|extracellular fluid|cord blood|after
kinetic studies were carried out on the ring opening of the quaternary nitrogen cation coralynium ion i to yield acetylpapaverine iii on the cyclization of iii to yield i and on a photochemical reaction undergone by i in aqueous solutions exposed to visible light from the results it was concluded that a i and iii are in facile equilibrium in aqueous solution but appreciable amounts of iii do not exist in dilute solutions with ph values below b the photochemical reaction of i in water presumably a photohydration can be reversed by lyophilization by heatiing and by increasing the ph of solutions to values greater than c the photochemical reaction of i can be inhibited by protecting the aqueous solutions from visible light and the rate in the presence of light can be reduced by increasing the concentration of i in the solution and d although the chloride and sulfoacetate salts of i react identically and have similar solubilities in water it is possible to prepare more concentrated and hence more stable solutions of the sulfoacetate salt by including sodium XTT in the solvent the solubility of coralyne chloride remains about the same in dilute sodium hydroxide as in water,180,hydroxide

these experiments were designed to study the mechanism of depletion of dopamine da in the striatum produced by alphamethylmtyrosine alphammt alphamethylmtyramine alphammta the metabolite of alphammt appears to be the AS dadepleting agent since the administration of a decarboxylase inhibitor before alphammt markedly reduced both the formation of alphammta and the SD of da after injection of alphammt mgkg ip the striatal concentration of homovanillic acid hva rose by at hour this is probably due to an increase in da metabolism since alphammt markedly enhanced the decline of da produced by alphamethylptyrosine alphampt at and hours after alphammt the concentration of hva and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was below control level the decrease in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid is due partially to a decreased formation of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid from da in striatal slices both alphammt and alphammta decreased the formation of hho and the accumulation of hda from htyrosine alphammt did not alter the TPS activity of htyrosine or release hda from the slices but it did inhibit the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in striatal homogenates at low concentrations of tyrosine mum alphammta released both newly synthesized and exogenously accumulated hda from striatal slices at low concentrations of alphammta the percent reduction in hho was much greater than the percentage of hda released into the medium however at higher concentrations the inhibition of hho reached a maximum while hda PR kept increasing these results suggest that both inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity and da release from storage CS by alphammta may account for the SD of da produced by the injection of alphammt,30|51|150|225|243|250,active|depletion|specific|release|sites|depletion

a study has been made of the formation of synapses in developing reinnervated and crossreinnervated amphibian twitch muscles which receive either a focal iliofibularis or a distributed sartorius innervation from en plaque nerve terminals using histological ultrastructural and electrophysiological techniques during the development of the tadpole through metamorphosis to the adult frog the sartorius myofibres increased in length at about twice the rate of the iliofibularis myofibres due to a fast rate of growth at their insertions on to the pelvic tendon the short iliofibularis and sartorius myofibres of young tadpoles mum long possessed only a single synapse and the iliofibularis myofibres did not receive any further innervation during development however the sartorius myofibres received further transient innervation on the new muscle laid down during development at the fast growing pelvic insertion until the distance between the original synapse formed on the myofibres and the synapse at the pelvic end of the muscle was about mm during OD synapses possessed either skewed multimodal or unimodal mepp amplitudefrequency distributions the intervals between mepps were not distributed randomly according to a poisson process as mepps of similar amplitudes tended to be separated by very short intervals the unitsize epp had a similar amplitudefrequency distribution as the mepps if these had a unimodal distribution reinnervation or crossreinnervation of the sartorius and the iliofibularis muscles in adults or at a late stage of development simply reconstituted the normal focal and distributed innervation patterns of the muscles as found in the control muscles of the CL and unoperated legs these observations on synapse formation in amphibia are consistent with the hypothesis that during OD the axon making the initial synaptic contact on the muscle cells induces a property over a length of muscle membrane adjacent to this site which makes it refractory to synapse formation thus during reinnervation or crossreinnervation of AD muscles this refractory property constrains synapse formation to these sites,157|250|268|306,development|contralateral|development|adult

histamine has a dual action on the isolated perfused ear preparation of the rb the amine induced a dosedependent rise in perfusion pressure when the preparation was perfused with krebs solution this pressor response was reversed to a depressor effect when meypramine was added to the perfusion fluid this depressor effect of the amine was also doserelated metiamide competitively inhibited the depressor effect of histamine prior treatment of the ear vessels with metiamide alone caused an increase in histamineinduced perfusion pressure from these results it was concluded that the predominant pressor effect of histamine on the vascular bed of the rb ear is mediated through the hreceptors and the depressor effect of the amine through histamine hreceptors,13|100,rabbit|rabbit
the rabbit pulmonary artery contains postsynaptic alphaadrenoceptors which meidate smooth muscle contraction its NE nerves contain presynaptic alphaadrenoceptors which mediate inhibition of the release of the transmitter evoked by nerve impulses DRCs for the pre and postsynaptic effects of eight alphareceptor agonists were determined on superfused strips of the artery in the presence of cocaine corticosterone and propranolo according to the concentrations which caused of the Emax ec post the postsynaptic rank order of potency was adrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than oxymetazoline greater than naphazoline greater than phenylephrine greater than tramazoline greater than alphamethylnoradrenaline greater than methoxamine the pa values of phentolamine againstoxymethazoline phenylephrine alphamethylnoradrenaline and methoxamine were and respectively for the investigation of presynaptic effects the arteries were preincubated with hnoradrenaline all agonists inhibited the overflow of 3H evoked by transmural sympathetic nerve stimulation according to the concentrations which reduced the stimulationinduced overflow by ec pre the rank order of potency was adrenaline greater than oxymetazoline greater than tramazoline greater than alphamethylnoradrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than naphazoline greater than phenylephrine greater than methoxamine m phentolamine shifted the presynaptic DR curves for moradrenaline and oxymethazoline to the RA the ratio ec preec post was calculated for each agonist as an index of its relative post and presynaptic potency according to the ratios the agonists were arbitrarily classified into three groups group ratio about preferentially postsynaptic agonists comprised methoxamine and phenylephrine group ratio near similar pre and postsynaptic potencies comprised noradrenaline adrenaline and naphazoline group ratio below preferentially presynaptic agonists comprised oxymetazoline alphamethylnoradrenaline and tramazoline as well as clonidine preferentially presynaptic and preferentially postsynaptic agonists had opposite effects on the basoconstrictor response to nerve stimulation methoxamine and phenylephrine either did not change or enhanced but never reduced the response in contrast oxymetazoline alphamethylnoradrenaline and tramazoline at low concentrations selectively inhibited the response to stimulation at low frequency hz it is concluded that alphaadrenoceptor agonists vary widely in their relative pre and postsynaptic potencies possibly because of structural differences between pre and postsynaptic alphareceptors pre and postsynaptic components contribute to their overll postsynaptic effec in actively transmitting synapses the preferential activation of presynaptic alphareceptors results in alphaadrenergic inhibition of synaptic transmission,13|31|66|129|181|189,noradrenergic|doseresponse curves|maximal contraction|tritium|doseresponse|right

nhcl was infused into the left renal artery of anesthetized dogs at mumkgmin for up to min renal blood flow declined early then increased to supracontrol levels during infusion kidneys perfused at mumkgmin for min showed patchy to confluent mixtures of cortical necrosis and tubular CN experimental kidneys invariably showed lower urine osmolality than CL controls h after perfusion kidneys with necrosis showed depressed creatinine clearance as well renal i.a. infusion of nh acetate or intravenous infusion of nahco during arterial infusion of nhcl prevented significant acidosis and caused minimal histological changes but depression of urine osmolality was not prevented it is concluded that renal ammonium concentrations up to mumliter for min does not cause tubular CN but does impair urine concentration severe tissue damage followed renal exposure to high ammonium concentrations in the presence of metabolic or renal acidosis,45|54|69|116,necrosis|contralateral|artery|necrosis

the responsiveness of the medullary chemoreceptors measured by the ventilatory response to hypercapnia given in an hyperoxic gas mixture in IN anesthetized dogs has been evaluated during normothermia and at two levels of hypothermia the response was studied in dogs during normothermia of these dogs at a blood temperature of degrees c and in the other dogs during deeper hypothermia degrees c the VE response to co decreased while blood temperature was lowered until the response became absent during deep hypothermia for NT and both C2 of hypothermia a similar oxygen drive of ventilation was found which was equivalent to approximately one fourth of the spontaneous ventilation it is suggested that in the deeply hypothermic animal the normal P0.1 is apparently of peripheral arterial chemoreceptor origin and when this drive is nullified or significantly decreased gentle shivering could be responsible for stimulating the respiratory center,20|63|82|85|118,intact|ventilatory|normothermia|levels|respiratory drive
metiamide an histamine hreceptors antagonist has been used to treat a case of zollingerellison syndrome characterized by a long standing diarrhea an important gastric hypersecretion and a moderatly elevated plasma gastrin but without digestive ulceration at the dose of mg per day metiamide induced a complete suppression of acid secretion an effect which lasted for days after stopping the drug accordingly and since the only finding at time of LAP was a small lymph node enlarged with endocrine M1 tissue the stomach was left intact and metiamide pursued during the first months of chronic administration of metiamide acid secretion was maintained at levels below pcent of initial values ulteriorly however although dosages of metiamide were increased acid hypersecretion resumed and a duodenal ulcer developed total gastrectomy was then performed months after the beginning of metiamide in spite of the failure of metiamide treatment the long term follow up of this case of zollingerellison syndrome allowed us to get theoretical and practical informations,69|78,laparotomy|metastatic

addition of ubiquinone to e coli ml membrane vesicles dramatically increases coupling between nadh oxidation and active transport such that initial rates and steadystate levels of lactose and aminoacid accumulation are comparable to those observed during dlactate oxidation similar but less dramatic effects are observed with the quinone and succinate or llactate in the presence of nadh and ubiquinone the vesicles also generate a membrane potential interior negative that is similar in magnitude to that observed in the presence of dlactate stimulation of nadhdependent transport by ubiquinone cannot be accounted for by increased rates of oxidation of nadh and the effect of the quinone on nadhdependent lactose transport is not observed in vesicles depleted of ND activity thus it is apparent that ubiquinone shunts electrons from nadh dehydrogenase nadhacceptoroxidoreductase ec to the portion of the respiratory chain containing the energycoupling site the findings demonstrate unequivocally that inefficient coupling of nadh oxidation to active transport cannot be due to the presence of inverted LDV in addition they provide further support for TPS localization of the energycoupling site,115|162|170,nadh dehydrogenase|vesicles|specific

in the albino rat the evolvement of myocardial necrosis induced by a single injection of iso was accompanied by a fall in total ne pretreatment with propranolol and pargyline protected against isoinduced necrosis and MH but did not influence the isoinduced SD of ne stores the depletion of ne stores is not due to impairment in synthesis or increased intraneuronal metabolism of ne since in isotreated rats neither cardiac tyrosine hydroxylase activity nor mao activity was altered the decrease in endogenous ne is not due to a defect in the storage of ne the ability of myocardium to take up and store ne returned to normal within hours whereas endogenous levels returned to normal within days even in the presence of demonstrable CN thus there is lack of correlation between chemical and morphological changes since catecholamine depletion occurred in the absence of morphologically demonstrable tissue injury and the CF of the adrenergic neuron returns to normal in the presence of demonstrable necrosis,34|41|122|148,myocardial hypertrophy|depletion|necrosis|function
the crucial point in the pathogenesis of isoproterenolinduced myocardial necrotization is an abundant intracellular ca accumulation leading to high SE phosphate exhaustion accordingly in the early stage of the isoproterenolinduced necrotization process the onset of atp and creatine phosphate breakdown strictly parallels the acute ca gain in this type of necrosis the mg losses from the myocardium appear as a concomitant phenomenon the hearts can be protected against the deleterious ca overload and necrotization by increasing the plasma concentration of mg k or h ions in order to counterbalance ca according to the ration see article on the other hand if mg k or h ion concentrations are too low isoproterenolinduced ca uptake and myocardial lesions are potentiated,19,energy

by quantitative stimulation of the vagus SN of isolated rabbit atria frequencyresponse relations were obtained for both the electrotropic effect reduction of the area of the monophasic action potential and the inotropic response an addition of hexamethonium in a final concentration of gml resulted in a diminution of vagal effectivity in the range of lower and medium frequencies of stimulation and was connected with a shift of the frequencyresponse characteristic to the right at higher frequencies vagal effectivity was increased in contrast to the inhibitory effect of hexamethonium the facilitating action is irreversible by raising the concentration up to gml the vagal effects were reduced to a C1 extent and the frequency dependence of the response was abolished at medium frequencies in the range of sec to sec this dependence was reestablished and may be considered as a part of a normal frequencyresponse relation extremely shifted to the RA the time courses of both types of effect are characterized by a steep rise and a decay of the response during the stimulation period a mathematical handling of the frequencyresponse characteristics provides quantitative evidence for the extent of the hexamethonium blockade of vagal ganglion cells in the atria furthermore it leads to the conception of these cells to act as a distributing system for a homogeneous innervation by a widespread divergency of postganglionic fibres,6|107|148,nerves|large|right
several years ago theorell and czerlinski conducted experiments on the system of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and imidazole using the first version of the temperature jump apparatus with detection of changes in fluorescence these early experiments were repeated with improved instrumentation and confirmed the early experiments in GA terms however the improved detection system allowed to measure a slight concentration dependence of the relaxation time of around ms furthermore the chemical relaxation time was smaller than the one determined earlier by factor the data were evaluated much more rigorously than before allowing an AGA interpretation of the results the observed relaxation time is largely due to rate constants in an interconversion of ternary complexes which are faster than three of the four dissociation rate constants determined previously by theorell and mckinleymckee this fact contributed to earlier difficulties of finding any concentration dependence however the IB of imidazole to the binary enzymecoenzyme complex can be made to couple kinetically into the interconversion rate of the two ternary complexes the observed signal derives largely from the ternary complexes a substantial fluorescence signal change is associated with the observed EC50 process suggesting a relocation of the imidazole in REF to the nicotinamide moiety of the bound coenzyme nine models are considered with two types of coupling of preequilibria noneall quantitative evaluations favor the MM with two ternary complexes connected by an interconversion outside the fourstep bimolecular cycle the ternary complex outside the cycle has much higher fluorescence yield than the one inside the interconversion equilibrium is near unity for imidazole if it would be shifted very much to the side of the deadend complex as in isobutyramide stimulating action could not take place,51|97|148|190|199|224,general|appropriate|binding|relaxation|reference|model

the question of ph or flow dependence for the renal elimination of procainamide pca was studied under conditions in each of subjects each subject received mg of pca intravenously at weekly intervals while in a state of acid load nhcl and water deprivation acid load and water excess alkali load nahco and WD and alkali load and water excess plasma and urine were collected at frequent intervals for pca and nacetyl pca napa analysis urine flow rates varied markedly between the WD and water excess states approximately vs mlmin respectively and urine ph varied markedly between the acid and alkali load states ph ca vs respectively despite this marked R2 there were no significant changes in pca renal clearance or hr pca or napa excretion if passive DWI of pca were taking place such flow and ph changes would have caused marked changes in pca clearance were the ph partition hypothesis true we therefore conclude that passive diffusion is not an important mechanism in the renal elimination of pca in man and that there must be tubular secretion the implication for the clinical use of the drug is that dose adjustments need not be made in response to variations in urine flow and ph,52|81|109|127,water deprivation|water deprivation|variation|diffusion
a retrospective crosssectional T0 was carried out on data derived from single h urine collections from male idiopathic calcium stoneformers the daily urine volume and ph and the exretions of calcium oxalate phosphate creatinine and magnesium were related to the time of year when the urine was collected and the saturation of urine with calcium Ox and octocalcium phosphate calculated for each month there were significant seasonal variations in the urinary excretion of calcium and oxalate each showing a maximum during the summer months and a minimum in the winter there was no significant seasonal variation in urinary ph volume creatinine phosphate or magnesium there was a significant increase in the saturation of urine with calcium oxalate and a trend towards higher saturation levels of octocalcium phosphate in the summer these changes were dependent only on the seasonal variation in urinary calcium and Ox and not on urine volume a retrospective study of the seasonal incidence of stone episodes among these stoneformers showed that the rate of stone passage per month was higher in the summer than in the winter there was no significant seasonal R2 in the incidence of stones removed surgically,3|55|143|185,study|oxalate|oxalate|variation

in deltachymotrypsin the CR of methionine towards pnitrophenacyl bromide is strongly reduced when the alphaamino group of isoleucine has been acetylated since acetylation of isoleucine brings deltachymotrypsin to a conformation similar to its ALP one this suggests that methionine should present an impaired reactivity in the alkaline conformation of the protein it is indeed observed that its chemical CR as a CF of ph depends on the ionization state of the alphaamino group of isoleucine pkapp at degrees c as does the structure of the enzyme reciprocally T3 chemical reaction of methionine with hydrogen peroxide isoleucine presents a slower rate of reaction with fluorescamine than when methionine is free as a result of methionine oxidation the apparent pk of the alkaline transition is shifted from to about at degrees c this is reflected in the disappearance of the lag phase previously observed for the initial activity of the enzyme when it is incubated at alkaline ph eur j biochem the absence of chemical reactivity of methionine in the alkaline state of the enzyme is confirmed by the appearance of a lag phase in the reaction of the protein with iodoacetate after an incubation at ALP ph such a lag phase does not appear when this incubation is carried out at neutral ph since this lag phase is similar to that which shows up in the activity during the isomerization of the enzyme from its alkaline to its neutral state the present data are interpreted as implying a concerted movement of isoleucine and methionine during this isomerization process they also indicate that in the alkaline form of the enzyme methionine has moved back into the interior of the protein since the spectroscopic properties of the zymogen and of the highph form of the enzyme are similar they suggest that Met occupies in the alkaline conformation of the enzyme a similar position as it does in the zymogen,3|33|58|61|87|194|298,reactivity|alkaline|reactivity|function|after|alkaline|methionine

a cytochrome c derivative from which iron is removed has been prepared and characterized several lines of evidence indicate that native and porphyrin cytochrome c have similar conformations they have similar elution characteristics on sephadex gel chromatography in both proteins the tryptophan fluorescence is quenched and the pk values of protonation of the porphyrin are identical porphyrin cytochrome c does not substitute for native cytochrome c in either the oxidase reaction or in restoring electron transport in cytochromecdepleted mitochondria it does however competitively inhibit native cytochrome c in these reactions the ki for inhibition being larger than the km for reaction the absorption and emission spectra and the polarized excitation spectrum of the porphyrin cytochrome c are characteristic of free base porphyrin the absence of fluorescence quenching of porphyrin cytochrome c when the protein is bound to cytochrome oxidase suggests that heme to heme distance between these proteins is larger than to nm depending upon orientation binding of the porphyrin cytochrome c to phospholipids or to mitochondria increases the FP of a positively polarized absorption band which indicates that the bound form of the protein does not rotate freely within the time scale of relaxation from the excited state,169,fluorescence polarization

in this study of the binding properties of Ins hexaphosphate and bisphosphoglycerate to chicken and human deoxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin were compared it appeared that in all cases the IB to chicken hemoglobin is much stronger than to human hemoglobin this is very probably due to the fact that out of the residues responsible for the binding of phosphates in chicken hemoglobin are arginines these are absent in human hemoglobin where the IB site is made up to only residues for chicken hemoglobin one strong IB site could be observed in both unliganded and liganded hemoglobin from these observations we conclude that the same binding site is involved in both the oxy and deoxy structure showing different affinity to phosphates in the two conformational states for HbA we reached the same conclusion,8|28|71|84|125,inositol|binding|binding|binding|human hemoglobin

a pneumococcal mutant sulrc resistant to sulfonamides and three transformants bearing associated d or d resistance markers have earlier been reported to be unstable and show distinct patterns and frequencies of segregating SD progeny lacking the c marker each of the four strains showed a characteristic dosage of the genes involved in the merodiploidy complementary strands of dnas from these stable and unstable strains were resolved and homoduplex and heteroduplex hybrids made from the separated dna strands were used as donors in genetic transformations activities of a normal marker streptomycin resistance and those involved in the heterozygosity c d and d were quantitatively measured from those heteroduplexes made up of opposite strands derived from a heterozygote and a stable CS the normal marker is transferred efficiently but the heterozygous markers are not on the other hand if both strands of a heteroduplex are derived from different heterozygotic strains all markers can be transferred with usual efficiency to a stable recipient strain the lowered efficiency in the former type of heteroduplex is attributed to an inhomology resulting from a tandem duplication in the merodiploid strains and a postulated dna repair process stimulated by it while in the form of the donor duplex the inhomology probably includes a a microheterogeneity between the c site and the wild type locus and b a more extensive incompatibility attributable to an extra segment of genome in a tandem duplication covering the c and d sites the first of these inhomologies produces a lowered efficiency of transfer from all configurations of the particular d S2 associated with the mutant c marker and therefore accounts for the characteristic transfer patterns even from the native merodiploid dnas,32|119|258,stable|strain|allele
the dna of a sulfonamideresistant pneumococcal strain heterozygous for sulrc and that of three highly resistant and persistently heterozygous cd transformants derived by introducing sulrc marker into a stable sulfonamide resistant strain sulrd were studied to analyze the genetic basis of their merodiploidy the physical properties of the native and denatured dna from the heterozygotes and the nonheterozygous strains were not distinguishable the denaturability and the renaturability of biological activity for the heterozygous markers were essentially identical to those of the normal markers the heterozygosity extends to the closely linked locus giving rise to four different configurations of cd and cd transformants characterized by their frequencies of segregation and donormarker MICs the markeractivity ratios and the frequency of cotransfer of heterozygous markers were found to remain the same in each when the donor dna was native denatured or reannealed without fractionation or reannealed after remixing of resolved strands possible models were weighed against these observations and these considerations led to the suggestion that tandem duplication of a gene region may be responsible for the heterozygosity and instability of this region a more detailed examination of this model will be presented in an accompanying paper,110,activities

the etiologic and pathophysiologic findings described in the first part of this paper have important consequences the recognition of the specific etiology of diarrhea requires new laboratory methods most of these however are technically easy to perform and do not require a large laboratory a longranging consequence of this changed concept is a wellfounded modification of therapy the most important discovery was that in a well balanced glucose electrolyte solution sodium and glucose enhance their absorption mutually and increase the absorption of water by solvent drag since in most acute diarrheas the mechanisms of absorption of glucose and electrolytes are retained this mechanism can be utilized for fast oral rehydration and reinstitution of normal intestinal homeostasis prompt institution of a diet consisting of the previously mentioned glucoseelectrolyte solution usually prevents severe dehydration and the need for stationary treatment the elimination of lactose and long chain fatty acids from the diet prevents continuation of the pathologic osmotic and chemical conditions in the intestine antibiotics are not indicated in AD with the exception of diarrhea caused by enteroinvasive e coli or shigella in the case of salmonellagastroenteritis even contraindicated further research concentrates on the OD of drugs for neutralisation of e coli enterotoxin and the prevention of diarrheas by development of ERP vaccines,167|192|209,acute diarrhea|development|effective
originally many of the initiators of the world population conference which took place in bucharest in had hoped that the conference would imply a final breakthrough for the view that family planning measures should be given top priority in all lessdeveloped countries in fact however the plan of action passed by the conference contains very little relating to population and family planning instead the document is dominated by wordy phrases about the necessity of attaining social and economic development in those countries will the insight that family planning programs work efficiently only if they are an integral part of programs for the social and economic development of a country lead to such programs being realized there is every reason to doubt that the plan of action will have any such effect the reasons for the underdevelopment of third world countries cannot be removed through such UN resolutions in the peoples republic of china family planning is widely accepted especially in the towns and now also among the rural population limiting the number of children is considered part of chinas OD effort china is a lessdeveloped country that is in the process of rapid social and economic development the issue at stake in other third world countries is how to achieve a similar OD as soon as this goal is achieved FP efforts are meaningful and have a chance of success the experience of china demonstrates that even there it took time before the efforts succeeded there are many third world countries that could without much difficulty support a population considerably larger than the present one but there are no doubt also a number of countries where the population is already so large that a continued population increase would be harmful the need to achieve rapid development becomes increasingly urgent not in the least to make it possible to attain a reduced population growth the sad truth is that so little development takes place in those countries without social and economic development the present rapid population increase will continue in those countries where there is already an overly dense population,145|179|212|220,united nations|development|development|family planning

the excretion of the enzyme gammaglutamyltranspeptidase and its isoenzymes into the urine was investigated in patients with renal diseases and compared with the excretion of the enzymes leucineaminopeptidase and lactatedehydrogenase in animal experiments an increased excretion of these enzymes was found after autotransplantation increased excretion of gammaglutamyltranspeptidase was also found in patients with glomerulonephritis and in the polyuric phase of acute tubular necrosis but not in cases of pyelonephritis and in the oliguric phase of acute tubular CN the alterations of the isoenzyme pattern during diseases with increased enzyme excretion are in accordance with the hypothesis that the enzymes are liberated from the kidney tissue into the urine and only a minority stems from the blood investigation of the excretion of gammaglutamyltranspeptidase and its isoenzymes into the urine seems to be of both scientific and clinical interest,77,necrosis

a hypothesis that preferential rejection of donor markers by the hex system of pneumococcus is due to lethal doublestrand breaks has been examined in terms of its implications for the extent of the excision required experiments reported here were directed at asking whether hexdependent marker efficiency depends on the length of the donor dsDNA dna in the absence of intracellular competition for hex function there was no detectable effect of dna size on hexdependent marker efficiency as donor dna was sheared from greater than x daltons to x daltons the latter dna was purified by two successive velocity fractionations to ensure that the activity seen was representative of dna of that size quantitative examination of the system shows that for the lethal event hypothesis to be true the excision step has to remove an average of to nucleotides this figure is so much greater than that seen in other excision processes that alternate hypotheses should be considered the presently known properties of the hex system can be accounted for by a model invoking the migratory features of type i restriction enzymes,53,deoxyribonucleic acid
the enhancement of ergot alkaloid production by tryptophan and its analogues in both normal and highphosphate cultures is more directly related to increased dimethylallyltryptophan dmat synthetase activity rather than to a lack of regulation of the tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes thiotryptophan betabenzothienylalanine is rather ineffective in the end product regulation of tryptophan biosynthesis whereas tryptophan and methyltryptophan are potent effectors the presence of increased C2 of dmat synthetase in ergot cultures supplemented with tryptophan or thiotryptophan and to a lesser extent with methyltryptophan suggests that the induction effect involves de novo synthesis of the enzyme thiotryptophan and tryptophan but not methyltryptophan can overcome the block of alkaloid synthesis by inorganic phosphate the results with thiotryptophan indicate that the phosphate effect cannot be explained merely on the basis of a block of tryptophan synthesis,63,levels

rifampinresistant mutants were isolated from lactobacillus casei s and examined for possible simultaneous alteration in nutritional properties among the mutants obtained either spontaneously or after mutagenesis with aminopurine were found to be altered with respect to the specific growth requirements the majority of of the latter mutants were shown to require lglutamine in addition to the nutrients required by the parental strain for maximal growth whereas the remaining mutants had apparently lost the requirement for laspartate further studies with one of the glutaminerequiring mutants revealed that the rifampin resistance of this CS is due to the resistance of ribonucleic acid polymerase itself and that a single mutation is responsible for both rifampin resistance and the glutamine requirement these results strongly indicate that a structural alteration of the ribonucleic acid polymerase caused by the rifampin resistance mutation somehow affected glutamine metabolism possibly through change in selective transcription of the genes involved,91,strain

the IB of phydroxymercuribenzoate to human methemoglobin causes a perturbation of the visible heme abosrption spectrum which is expressed by an increase in absorbance in the high spin band regions to nm and to nm concomitant with a decrease in absorbance in the alpha and betaband absorption regions the ph dependence of the phydroxymercuribenzoateinduced difference spectrum can be accounted for quantitatively by a shift toward higher spin of the aquo form of methemoglobin a shift toward higher spin of the hydroxide form and a shift in the apparent pka for the water to hydroxide transition from to when mercurial is bound the rate of these heme abosrbance changes is consistent with the rapid second order formation of the beta cysteine mercurymercaptide bond and does not represent a change due to the dissociation of methemoglobin tetramers into dimers even though the latter slow process does follow mercurial binding the observation of an increase in spin produced by the IB of a reagent which also promotes dimer formation argues strongly against any direct correlation between an increase in spin and the appearance of deoxyhemoglobinlike conformations,1|157,binding|binding
the observed static difference spectrum produced by inositol hexaphosphate binding to methemoglobin is the sum of a very fast and a slow spectral transition the more rapid absorbance NC is too fast to be measured by stopped flow techniques whereas the slow NC exhibits a halftime in the range to s from the ph dependence of the rapidly formed difference spectrum and from a series of heme ligand binding studies the rapid phase is interpreted to reflect a localized tertiary conformational change which immediately accompanies inositol hexaphosphate IB and results in a selective increase in spin and reactivity of the beta chain heme groups in contrast the slow phase appears to reflect a first order isomerization process which involves only a small portion less than of the hemoglobin molecules and results primarily in a marked alteration of the spectral properties of the alpha chains with little change in spin while the rapid spectral transition cannot be directly related to the overall quaternary transition which occurs during oxygen binding to ferrous deoxyhemoglobin the slow spectral transition may represent the abortive formation of a deoxyhemoglobin alike conformation which is inhibited in both rate and extent by the presence of water molecules bound to the heme iron atoms,28|42|87,change|change|binding

the elution bands of acidic and NAA of protein hydrolysates emerging from the column of a cationexchange resin crosslinked with pure mdivinylbenzene are narrower than those from a resin prepared from ST and technical divinylbenzene as a result of these narrower bands a more complete resolution of the critical pairs threonineserine glycinealanine and tyrosinephenylalanine is obtained the most probable reason for the narrower elution peaks is the more rapid DWI of the exchanged components through the bulk of the resin as a result of a more regular arrangement of crosslinkages in the cationexchange resin prepared from mdivinylbenzene,6|31|69,neutral amino acids|styrene|diffusion

when solutions of nucleoside phosphates and trimetaphosphate are dried out at room temperature nucleoside polyphosphates are formed the mg ion shows a superior catalytic CF in this reaction when compared with other divalent metal ions starting with nucleoside phosphates mg and trimetaphosphate the predominant products in the nucleoside polyphosphate series pnn are pn pn and pn nucleoside diphosphates yield pn and pn nucleoside triphosphates give pn and pn the prebiological relevance of these reactions is discussed,24,function
one of the major diagenetic pathways of organic matter in recent sediments involves the condensation of cellular constituents particularly amino acids and sugars into insoluble melanoidintype polymers these polymers consist mainly of humic and fulvic acids and make up the major part of the organic carbon reservoir in recent sediments we suggest that a similar set of reactions between abiotically formed amino acids and sugars and more generally between aldehydes and amines occurred on a large scale in the prebiotic hydrosphere the rapid formation of this insoluble polymeric material would have removed the bulk of the DOC from the primitive oceans and would thus have prevented the formation of an organic soup melanoidin polymers have several properties which make them attractive hypothetical precursors of contemporary oxidationreduction coenzymes they contain heterocyclic nitrogen compounds similar to the nitrogenous bases they contain a high concentration of stable free radicals and they tend to concentrate those heavy metals which play prominent roles in contemporary enzymic redox processes the prebiotic formation of similar polymers could therefore have provided the starting point for a basic class of biochemical reactions we suggest that the prebiotic scenario involved chemical and protoenzymic reactions at the sedimentocean interface in relatively shallow waters and under conditions not much different from those of the recent environment,96,dissolved organic carbon
imidazole catalysis of phenylalanyl transfer from phenylalanine adenylate anhydride to the hydroxyl groups of homopolyribonucleotides was investigated as a chemical model of the biochemical aminoacylation of trna imidazole catalyzed transfer of phenylalanine to polyu increases from ph to and decreases above ph at ph approximately of the phenylalanyl residues are transferred to polyu at ph transfer to polyu was five times as great as to polya and transfer to a polya polyu double helix was negligible at ph approximately mole percent linkages to polyu were monomeric phenylalanine the remainder of the linkages were peptides of phenylalanine the number of linkages and their lability to base and neutral hydroxylamine indicates that phenylalanine and its peptides are attached as esters to the hydroxyl groups throughout polyu and the hydroxyl CG at the terminus of polyu these results do model the contemporary process of aminoacyl transfer to trna and continue to suggest that a histidine residue is in the active site of aminoacyltrnasynthetases,127,groups
lethally irradiated male and female hybrids parental strains and the third party strain a mice were inoculated with reciprocal hybrid marrow from donors of the same sex a graftversushost reaction was produced against hy antigens of reciprocal hybrids although the late mortality in inbred strain males was generally greater than that of females without further tests this difference was not automatically attributable to an x or a y chromosome disparity hybrids did not recognize the qualitative difference in antigenicity of their reciprocals but they were able to recognize the quantitatively greater antigenicity of their parental strains and a hybridversusparental CS reaction occurred the graftversushost reaction in the third party strain a mice was significantly more severe than that produced by hybrid marrow in their reciprocal hybrid recipients but significantly less severe than that produced in the parental strains the relationship between antigenicity and responsiveness was such that the severity of the graftversushost reactions masked the maternal influences observed with other reciprocal hybrids,99,strain
comparative data on quaternary structure cooperativity bohr effect and regulation by organic phosphates are reviewed for vertebrate hemoglobins a phylogeny of hemoglobin function in the vertebrates is deduced it is proposed that from the monomeric hemoglobin of the common ancestor of vertebrates a deoxy dimer as seen in the lamprey could have originated with a single CAA substitution the deoxy dimer has a bohr effect cooperativity and a reduced oxygen affinity compared to the monomer one or two additional CAA substitutions could have resulted in the origin of a tetrameric deoxy hemoglobin which dissociated to dimers on oxygenation gene duplication giving incipient alpha and beta genes probably preceded the origin of a tetrameric oxyhemoglobin the origin of an organic phosphate IB site on the tetrameric hemoglobin of an early fish required only one or two amino acid substitutions atp was the first organic phosphate regulator of hemoglobin function the binding of atp by hemoglobin may have caused the original elevation in the concentration of atp in the red blood cells by relieving end product inhibition of atp synthesis the switch from regulation of hemoglobin CF by atp to regulation by dpg may have been a consequence of the curtailment of oxidative phosphorylation in the red blood cell the basic mechanisms by which atp and dpg concentrations can respond to strss on the oxygen transport system were present before the origin of an organic phosphate IB site on hemoglobin a switch from atp regulation to ip regulation occurred in the common ancestor of birds,56|79|120|184|234,amino acid|amino acid|binding|function|binding

this report is an attempt to study the renal handling of chromium under in vitro conditions and to relate this to the actions of the ion in the production of nephrotoxicity renal slice techniques were employed in these studies and were used to examine the effects of chromium on various renal transport processes in addition the accumulation of chromium by the renal tissue has also been studied marked accumulation by renal cortical slices of the rat was observed when crlabeled chromate or dichromate was added to the bathing solution some metabolic inhibitors interfered with this uptake process in addition some substrates metabolized by renal tissue reduced the accumulation of cr the use of cr dichromate and crchromate as well as alterations in the bathing solution ph indicated that in the rat chromium can interfere with renal transport processes but that the oxidation state of this metal is not important on the other hand in the rb a greater interference with cr uptake was noted at lower bathing solution phs this is interpreted to mean that chromate is the effective inhibitor in this species,155,rabbit
pHa pco and osmolality were determined serially during cardiac resuscitation in patients and in dogs with and without administration of sodium bicarbonate these studies demonstrate that in the absence of preexisting acidosis severe acidosis can be prevented by adequate ventilation alone sodium bicarbonate administration results in a significant rise in arterial pco which parallels the rise in ph despite adequate ventilation during prolonged cardiac and resuscitation there is a rise in arterial osmolality that is accentuated by sodium bicarbonate these studies suggest that sodium bicarbonate should not be used during resuscitation in the absence of effective hyperventilation or where carbon dioxide removal is inadequate despite adequate ventilation in repeated doses without confirmation of substantial acidosis or when CA has been of brief duration and preexisting acidosis is unlikely these studies also point to the need for a reappraisal of other buffers that do not elevate the arterial pco,0|117,arterial ph|cardiac arrest
the membrane site responsible for anomalous rectification was determined in frog sartorius muscle SF the total currentvoltage relation of glyceroltreated SF which represents mainly the properties of the sarcolemma was linear for membrane potentials between about and mv thus moderate depolarizationinduced anomalous rectification in intact fibers represents a property of the sarcotubular system the absence of slow hyperpolarization in glyceroltreated fibers was caused by the abolition of early conductance increase and the sarcotubular system is responsible for the inward rectifier picrotoxin selectively inhibited both moderate depolarizationinduced anomalous rectification and hyperpolarizationinduced early conductance increase this suggests that the same component in the sarcotubular system is responsible for these conductance changes the inhibition with picrotoxin of moderate depolarizationinduced anomalous rectification suggests the possibility that it is caused by an electrogenic effect rather than a decrease in gK a sarcolemmal hyperpolarizationactivated slow conductance increase was revealed,13|20|134,fibers|fibers|k conductance
total currentvoltage relations were analyzed on nine glyceroltreated surface fibers of frog sartorius muscles in tetrodotoxincontaining isotonic normal ringer solution the results indicate that delayed rectification occurs in the sarcolemma on large depolarization and that delayed rectification is only partially inactivated during sec of depolarization and not converted into anomalous rectification the time to peak the time course of inactivation and the potassium activation potential determined in glyceroltreated SF were comparable to those analyzed previously in intact fibers the value of the conductance increase during delayed rectification in glyceroltreated fibers appeared to be smaller than that in intact fibers,68,fibers
the properties of the hyperpolarizationactivated sarcolemmal slow conductance increase in frog sartorius muscle fibers have been investigated using EDTA disodium salt edta and propionate ringer solution more than sec was required for maximum activation of the sarcolemmal slwo conductance increase it is suggested that although the sarcolemmal slow conductance increase was affected by deterioration the conductance increase is not a direct product of deterioration but it represents a property of the sarcolemma which is encountered in physiological range the sarcolemmal conductance increase was rather insensitive to the NC in ph of ringer solution it is inferred that the absence of bellying in newly penetrated intact fibers at neutral and alkaline phs is caused mainly by the shunting effect of C1 parallel conductance apparent augmentation with edta of the sarcolemmal conductance increase infers that ca ions affect the conductance increase the conductance increase occurred also in the edtacontaining cldeficient solution the sarcolemmal slow conductance increase has been compared with the NC in GCl reported by hutter and warner and warner,18|87|119|159|161,ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid|change|large|change|cl conductance

dopamine is a directacting catecholamine with a short halflife that has many advantages in treating visceral hypoperfusion states such as shock and refractory heart failure unlike other inotropic drugs dopamine directly dilates the MES renal and CBF vessels and redirects blood flow to essential viscera this DA effect is prominent with doses of mugmin in adults and is attenuated by phenothiazines and haloperidol at doses of mugmin dopamine also has a significant betaadrenergic inotropic effect increasing myocardial contractility the inotropic effect is equivalent to that of isoproterenol epinephrine and norepinephrine but tachycardia tachyarrhythmias and angina may be less frequent with dopamine in doses greater than mugmin dopamine is a vasoconstrictor with pressor effects usually equivalent to that of norepinephrine dopamine dilates pupils does not dilate bronchi and does not shunt blood from viscera to skeletal muscles as does isoproterenol because dopamine increases myocardial +dP/dt selectively redistributes perfusion to essential viscera and allows a pharmacologic titration of effect it is a logical firstchoice catecholamine for treatment of shock and refractory HF,33|36|46|143|169,mesenteric|cerebral|dopaminergic|contractility|heart failure

the influence of some drugs on the effect of morphine on the threshold pressure required to elicit peristalsis in the guinea pig ileum in situ was studied in order to test the hypothesis that this effect of morphine is mediated by catecholamine PR tachyphylaxis to this effect of morphine was confirmed pretreatemnt with two mgkg doses of reserpine and hrs before the experiment significantly reduced the effect of morphine on the pressure threshold the iv administration of mgkg dldopa reestablished the effect of morphine in reserpinized animals to the level of the UT controls pretreatment with guanethidine mgkg decreased and even prevented this effect of morphine phentolamine i.c.v. mgkg also significantly inhibited the effect of morphine neither dci nor propranolol influenced this morphine effect pretreatment with reserpine guanethidine or phentolamine reduced the basic pressure threshold needed to elicit peristalsis the possibility that the decrease of local circulation induced by hypotenison would reduce the local concentration of morphine was rejected because the same doses of guanethidine or phentolamine did not modify the effect of hexamethonium given iv in this preparation all these results support the idea that the effect of morphine on intestinal peristalsis is mediated by a catecholamine acting on alphareceptors eg norepinephrine,42|92|107,release|untreated|pretreatment

betabungarotoxin a presynaptic neurotoxin isolated from the venom of the snake bungarus multicinctus has been shown to modify release of neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction in this communication we demonstrate that betabungarotoxin is a potent phospholipase a phosphatide acyl hydrolase ec comparable in activity with purified phospholipase enzymes from naja naja and vipera russellii the phospholipase activity of betabungarotoxin requires calcium and is stimulated by deoxycholate when strontium replaces calcium no phospholipase activity is detected since neuromuscular transmission is not blocked when calcium is replaced by strontium it was possible to examine the effects of the toxin on NMT in the presence of strontium under these conditions when the phospholipase activity should be inhibited the toxin has little or no effect on NM transmission if betabungarotoxin owes its toxicity in part to its enzymatic activity then it must be placed in a different class from those toxins which produce their effect by IB passively to an AGA receptor,98|122|152|156,neuromuscular transmission|neuromuscular|binding|appropriate
the method of dna ALP elution was applied to a study of the formation and resealing of dna singlestrand breaks T3 irradiation of human fibroblasts with ultraviolet CS uv the general features of the results were consistent with current concepts of dna excision repair in that breaks appeared rapidly after uv and resealed slowly in NF whereas breaks did not appear in those cells of patients with xeroderma pigmentosum xp that are known to have defects in dna repair synthesis the appearance of breaks required a short postuv incubation consistent with the expected action of an endonuclease cells of the variant form of xp characterized by normal dna repair synthesis exhibited normal production of breaks after uv but were slower than normal cells in resealing these breaks this difference was enhanced by caffeine a MM is proposed to relate this finding with a previously described defect in postreplication repair in these xp variant cells dna crosslinking appears to cause an underestimate in the measurement of dna breakage after uv,4|20|27|55|134,alkaline|after|light|normal fibroblasts|model

the cellular content of acetylcoa carboxylase acetylcoacarbondioxide ligase adpforming ec in saccharomyces cerevisiae is reduced by the addition of longchain fatty acids to the culture medium mutant strains of s cerevisiae defective in acylcoa synthetase acidcoa ligase ampforming ec were isolated and used to determine whether fatty acid itself or a metabolite of fatty acid is more directly responsible for the repression of acetylcoa carboxylase cells of the mutant strains were capable of incorporating HFA to an extent comparable to that observed with the wildtype strain but they accumulated markedly more of the incorporated HFA in the nonesterified form than did the wildtype cells the level of acetylcoa carboxylase activity in the mutants in contrast to that in the wildtype strain was hardly affected by the addition of fatty acids to the medium these results indicate that the activation of exogenous fatty acid is required for the repression of acetylcoa carboxylase supporting the view that the repressive effect is mediated by some compound metabolically derived from fatty acid,74|94,fatty acid|fatty acid
villus tip cells and crypt cells of rat jejunal mucosa were separated by the planning procedure of imondi et al and were studied with respect to their activities of the enzymes of the gammaglutamyl cycle and glutathione content the villus tip cells exhibit much higher gammaglutamyl transpeptidase activities than do the crypt cells thus gammaglutamyl trnaspeptidase appears to be a villusspecific enzyme gammaglutamyl cyclotransferase and the enzymes required for glutathione synthesis are not specifically localized to either the crypt or villus tip cells but are present in both the crypt cells have a high concentration of glutathione mm comparable to the levels found in CL and kidney in contrast the villus tip cells have much lower concentrations on fasting the glutathione concentration decreased markedly in both villus tip and crypt cells feeding of protein but not of SU led to increased glutathione concentrations the migration of cells from the undifferentiated crypt cell region to the villus tip is associated with structural and biochemical changes that equip the cell for its mature PET activities which include transport the present findings indicate that such cellular differentiation and migration is associated with a marked increase in gammaglutamyl transpeptidase activity and in the utilization of glutathione,104|137|171,liver|sucrose|functional

the kinetics of the action of local anesthetics upon firefly luciferin and luciferase systems is presented clinical concentrations of local anesthetics inhibited this atpinduced luminescence in a dosedependent manner from the effects of temperature and ph upon the inhibitory action of the local anesthetics it is concluded that hydrophobic ligandenzyme interaction is the predominant cause of the inhibition but hydrophilic interaction also contributes to the inhibition to a lesser degree a molecular theory of anesthesia is outlined which postulates that release of electrostricted water molecules from the hydrophilic parts of the enzyme due to the protein conformational changes induced by anesthetics is the cause of the decreased luminescence a similar mechanism is expected to occur at the CM which probably dehydrates the sodium channel and suppresses the conductance of this ion across the membrane these events lead to a volume expansion of the total system and the system becomes reactive to a pressure which reverses the anesthesia by shifting the equilibrium to the nonanesthetized original volume the pressure antagonism of anesthesia can be explained by this overall volume expansion and not by a mere swelling of the cell membrane,117,cell membrane

the fleas hind legs are the chief source of jumping power but in species which execute C1 jumps takeoff is accelerated by elastic energy released from a resilin pad rat with the wing hinge ligaments of flying insects situated in the pleural arch a central click mechanism operated by a rapid twitch of the trochanteral depressor the starter muscle synchronizes the separate sources of energy which power the jump cinÃ© photos confirm the morphological evidence that the flea takes off from the trochanters not the tarsi the loss of wings associated with lateral compression of the body and the shortening of the pleural ridge which thus lowers the position of the pleural arch together with modifications of the direct and indirect flight muscles are some of the main morphological features associated with the change from a flying to a saltatorial mode of progression the fleas takeoff basically resembles that of other panorpoid insects diptera mecoptera etc the release of elastic energy from the pleural arch is a system by which the force used to move the wings of flying insects is rapidly fed back into the legs and adds SP to the jump,16|29|189,large|homologous|power
the genetic apparatus of the cell is responsible for the accurate biosynthesis of the primary structure of macromolecules which then spontaneously fold up and in certain circumstances aggregate to yield the complex tertiary and quaternary structures of the biologically active molecules structures capable of selfassembly in this range from simple monomers through oligomers to complex multimeric structures that may contain more than one type of polypeptide chain and components other than protein it is becoming clear that even with the simpler monomeric enzymes there is becoming clear that even with the simpler monomeric enzymes there is a kinetically determined pathway for the folding process and that a folded protein must now be regarded as the minimum free energy form of the kinetically accessible conformations it is argued that the denatured subunits of oligomeric enzymes are likely to fold to something like their final structure before aggregating to give the native quaternary structure and the available evidence would suggest that this is so the importance of nucleation events and stable intermediates in the selfassembly of more complex structures is clear many selfassembling structures contain only MZ subunits and symmetry arguments are very successful in accounting for the structures formed because proteins are themselves complex molecules and not inelastic geometric objects the rules of strict symmetry can be bent and quasiequivalent bonding between subunits permitted this possibility is frequently employed in biological structures conversely symmetry arguments can offer a reliable means of choosing between alternative models for a given structure it can be seen that proteins gain stability by growing larger and it is argued in evolutionary terms that aggregation of subunits is the preferred way to increase the size of proteins the possession of quaternary structure by enzymes allows conferral of other biologically important properties such as cooperativity between active sites changes of specificity ATP channelling and sequential reactions within a multienzyme complex comparison is made of the invariant S1 compositions of the simpler oligomeric enzymes with the variation evidently open to say the oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes of e coli with viruses on the other hand the CF of the quaternary structure is to package nucleic acid and as an example the assembly and breakdown of tobacco mosaic virus is discussed attention is drawn to the possible ways in which the principles of selfassembly can be extended to make structures more complicated than those that can be formed by simple aggregation of the comonent parts,184|303|318|346,identical|substrate|subunit|function

four possible metabolic approaches to improving cardiac function in the presence of myocardial hypoxia have been considered it appears that there is increasing evidence which suggests that free fatty acids are harmful to the ischemic heart although it has been demonstrated that krebs cycle intermediates can result in anaerobic energy formation by the mitochondria and under certain extreme conditions can lead to improved performance of the heart the potential for a physiologically important effect of this approach is probably limited the protection of the ischemic or hypoxic heart by alkalosis may be a feasible approach the major beneficial effect appears to be exerted through more efficient conversion of energy that is already available to contractile performance rather than by increasing energy supply there appears to be some real potential for improving cardiac SE delivery via the glycolytic pathway calculations based on isolated rat heart studies indicate that at oxygenation glycolytic atp generation could totally correct for the deficit in mitochondrial atp formation therefore it is in the area of overcoming the inhibition of glycolytic atp formation and tapping this potential metabolic pathway that energy delivery may be restored toward normal in the hypoxic and perhaps the borderline zone of underperfusion in the ischemic heart the problem of the ischemic inhibition of glycolysis may partially be overcome by creating extracellular alkalosis but this presumption will have to be tested,132,energy

contractile performance of ICM feline myocardium was evaluated under conditions of selective changes in perfusate in ph and pco a substantial increase in myocardial performance was noted when the pco was lowered at constant ph and depression of performance was noted when the pco was increased at constant ph perfusate acidosis at constant pco resulted in depression of performance and decreased performance only after min of SE alkalosis did not increase performance and decreased performance transiently during mild ischemia these studies suggest that performance of myocardium during ischemia is closely related to tissue pco and is minimally related to the level of extracellular ph,3|66,ischemic|exposure

a simple membrane oxygenator for isolated organ perfusion is described the membrane employed consisted of an ordinary silicone rubber tubing mm internal diameter mm wall thickness the length of the tubing varying according to the required gas transfer when describing the capacity of the oxygenator it was found that the maximum gas transfer rate per unit membrane surface was an inadequate measure since this would vary with both flow rate through the oxygenator and the gas binding capacity of the perfusate the following formula for the function describing the relation between maximally possible change in gas concentration in the perfusate c flow rate f and actual NC in gas concentration in the perfusate u was proposed ucebf b being a constant specific for the gas and the membrane this formula was tested by a series of in vitro experiments and proved to give a valid description of the capacity of the oxygenator it was also found that carbon dioxide was always more easily transferred than oxygen so that oxygen transfer capcity was the limiting factor in the use of the oxygenator to facilitate the construction of the right size membrane a nomogram was constructed for oxygen transfer,106,change
a peroperative study of blood flow and flow direction was performed in series of patients with occlusive disease of the subclavian i.a. particular attention was focused on the flow variations caused by arm ischaemia and postischaemic hyperaemia and on the effect of injection of a vasodilator into the distal subclavian artery the effect on blood flow and flow direction was measured with the aid of an EMF during arm ischaemia induced by an inflated cuff on the arm the subclavian flow diminished as did the vertebral i.a. flow when it was VA if the vertebral artery flow was anterograde it increased during arm ischaemia the postischaemic hyperaemia caused an increase of the subclavian flow and of reversed vertebral flow if the vertebral flow was anterograde it diminished during the postischaemic hyperaemia similar findings were obtained with intraarterial injection of a vasodilator the large amount of blood flow passing through the vertebral i.a. as well as the flow variations caused by reactive arm hyperaemia emphasize the role of this artery as a collateral vessel to the UL in cases of the subclavian steal phenomenon,21|66|86|91|151|175,artery|electromagnetic flowmeter|artery|retrograde|artery|upper limb

the CSD and classification of histamine receptors in mammalian and avian tissues have been summarized in tables it is evident that histamine receptors are present on a number of morphologically distinct cell types and the proportion of cells bearing h and hreceptors varies not only with the species but also with the cell source the pharmacological receptors mediating mepyraminesensitive histamine responses have been defined as hreceptors receptors mediating mepyramineresistant but burimamide or metiamidesensitive histamine responses have been classified as hreceptors histamine responses mediated via hreceptors seem to involve the adenylcyclase system resulting in elevation of intracellular cyclicamp level which is susceptible to burimamide blockade but insensitive to betaadrenergic blocking agents this mode of action of histamine involving hreceptors and the adenyl cyclase system has been shown to stimulate the mammalian heart promote GAS inhibit antigeninduced HR from leucocytes and inhibit LMC it can further be concluded that both h and hreceptors are widely distributed throughout the animal body in the gastrointestinal reproductive respiratory and cardiovascular systems nervous system and on mast cells and blood leucocytes in these tissues histamine receptors play an important role in physiological immunological and immunopathological processes interaction of histamine with both h and hreceptors in varying proportions modulates the overall manifestation of cardiovascular and respiratory syndromes during certain immunopathological conditions eg inflammation allergy and anaphylaxis histamine receptors also appear to play and important role in the OD of immunocompetence and immunity,1|132|135|140|230,distribution|gastric acid secretion|histamine release|lymphocytemediated cytotoxicity|development

in most cases birth brings an infant who can rapidly adapt himself to a normal extrauterine life however sometimes and most of all in high risk cases this infant needs a correct surveillance before and after the delivery in order to prevent morbidity and especially perinatal morbidity our actual knowledge derived from the fantastic progress of perinatalogy demonstrates that in order to assure the wanted end of the pregnancy the only assistance of the delivery at hospital by a qualified obstetrician is not enough it is necessary to have a continuous surveillance at the beginning of the pregnancy and during the pregnancy and a correct attention at the mother foetus binomial during the labor and the delivery that will permit the discovery of pre para and PN AF to undertake the prevention and to lower the number of perinatal mortality,126|127,postnatal|factors

the T0 of P0 of birthweight less than or equal to g characterized by a common point the presence of placenta praevia in the mother enabled us to come to grips with the severe respiratory distress that these newborn can have from the clinical standpoint there is always early respiratory distress from the radiological standpoint by far the most dominant pathology was interstitial edema giving rise to a wet lung from the biochemical standpoint the blood gases were characterized in a certain number of cases by hypoxemia which was refractory to the usual forms of treatment from the mechanical standpoint measurements carried out in patients confirmed the extraordinary fall in these patients compliance the clinical radiological blood gas and mechanical analysis enabled one to differenciate main types of indications for artificial ventilation acute hypoxemia the idea of an increased need for oxygen in these types of indications for artificial ventilation it was apparent that the treatment of choice is constant positive pressure which may or may not be combined with intermittent positive pressure with this treatment technique none of the patients progressed to massive atelectasis it can be said that with the advent of techniques of ventilation by OHP combining ipp with cpp one has definitively eliminated from this pathological picture the principal cause of death anoxia due to massive alveolar collapse,1|3|198,study|newborn|high pressure
within the limits granted neuroleptanalgesia constitutes a very interesting technique in the major part of management of labour in particular it has the advantage of preserving maternal consciousness on the other hand it allows analgesia of rather long duration which renders early management of labour possible while still respecting its physiology the institution of this technique demands the presence at the parturients bedside not only of the obstetrician and the medwife but also that of a qualified anesthetist as in all cases of L1 management of labour it engages the responsability of the obstetrical team which undertakes it and this is even more so the earlier it is started to us its indications seem comparable with those of gamma oh the early management of labour however has the advantage over the latter of preserving maternal consciouness moreover it proved to be particularly interesting in the management of breech presentations but if its properties are an advantage in the indications which we have just mentioned they can constitute an invonvenience and restrain its use under different circumstances its slowness of induction the absence of narcosis which limits the effect on cervical resistance means that one prefers the toulouse method using pentothal for the management of labour after centimeters of dilatation in conclusion it seems important to us to state that neuroleptanalgesia is not the ideal method for management of labour any more than is thiopental or gammaoh other techniques merit being studied their T0 must obey strict rules in order to specify the risks and therefore the indications and limits it should cover different fields which are pharmacology the objective assessment by quantitative criteria of the effects on uterine contraction on the mothers clinical and biological state as well as that of the fetus in utero then that of the child in the first hours of live and up to the first years of his development,83|242,major|study
it is rather difficult to draw up a list of the drugs most frequently used during pregnancy and to specify their action on the mother the uterus ans the fetus bearing in mind the differences between them this difficulty results in particular from the high number of drugs owing to the frequency of prescriptions and selfmedication in the Pr woman who suffers from numerous disorders and the possibility of a pathology associated with the pregnancy or a pathology due to the pregnancy itself thereby defining the high risk pregnancy on this BG already modified by pregnancy under the hold of numerous drugs an anesthetic can be necessary in addition during labour or delivery the frequency of which can be estimated as being approximately per cent it is not possible to T0 all therapeutic agents in a single communication one can only evoke the influence of the most currently used drugs analgesics antibiotics diuretics sleeping tablets antihypertensives and those aimed at the neuropsychiatric system antidepression agents neuroleptics tranquillizers which are so frequently used at present finally during labour the number of parturients who receive no drugs is rare ocytocic and antispasmodic agents can also interfere with an anesthetic all of these ideas which are more and more difficult to acquire are important to know in fact the person in charge of the delivery must prescribe as little drugs as possible in order to avoid multiple drug interference which is rather difficult to predict knowing the possible action of drugs on the fetus in order to allow best adaptation to life in our atmosphere T3 delivery and foreseeing the possible necessity for an anesthetic in his turn the anesthetist should have a good knowledge of obstetrical physiology and pathology and the drugs capable of being used during pregnancy and labour in order to be able to choose the best adapted anesthetic this emphasized the importance of a well integrated obstetricoanesthetic team in which each member knows the problems of the other with the aim of being the least possible noxious for the mother and the future newborn the fetus this also emphasizes the necessity for anesthetists attached to the ostetrical unit knowing like the obstetrician the histories of those women with high risk pregnancies obstetrical anesthetics cannot be improvised,58|91|130|262,pregnant|background|study|after
the methods used for ventilation of the neonate shold be based upon consideration of the physiological changes which occure in the lungs and circulation at birth of the normal infant three important changes must be taken into consideration the first is the formation of a residual volume of alveolar gas the second the resorption of pulmonary fluid and the third a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance upon which is dependent the change from foetal circulation to that of the neonate to begin insufflation of foetal lungs it is necessary to use a pressure of between and cm ho after the first insufflation a good deal of air remains in the lungs even during expiration as long as pulmonary surfactant is present in the absence of the latter residual pressure at the end of expiration is necessary in order to avoid the lung emptying itself of air the resorption of pulmonary liquid from the alveolar spaces into the blood is dependent upon a change in the permeability of the AM epithelium which renders possible the rapid passage of water via the channels which open probably between the epithelial cells and this change is dependent upon an expansion of the lungs by a pressure of between and cm ho dilatation of the pulmonary vessels depends in part upon an increase in partial pressure of oxygen and a fall in carbon dioxide in the environment of the pulmonary arterioles and in part upon mechanical changes brought about by the movements of ventilatation,168,alveolar

the kinetic study of a process is usually performed by measuring a convenient intensive property p as a function of time the affinity rule states that when a given process takes place under different external constraints eg different temperatures pressures ph values etc the various p versus time curves are related by an affinity transformation parallel to the time axis in other words the p versus log time curves are parallel and can be superimposed by translation the validity of the rule has been extensively tested in chemical and physiochemical processes but there is no evidence as yet that it extends to biological systems the present paper shows that the rule is indeed valid for the kinetics of growth of an escherichia coli culture at various temperatures and ph values more extended experiments are necessary to prove or disprove the GA validity of the rule in biological systems but its practical interest is evident whenever it is valid it will be possible from a very small number of measurements to predict the complete behavior of the system in a number of various external conditions,140,general

the action of a number of compounds able to react with thiols was tested on guineapig NF perfused at constant pressure the sh reagents used were nano oxidized glutathione cystamine diamide difluorodinitrobenzene nitroglycerol sodium nitroferricyanide and hgcl dithiodinicotinic acid an sh reagent that does not penetrate the cell produced no effect all the other sh reagents produced an increase in coronary flow all except Ox glutathione and nitroglycerol increased the HR rate the increase in heart rate and oxygen consumption could be completely blocked by dichloroisoproterenol the increase in coronary flow was not affected difluorodinitrobenzene diamide cystamine and nano significantly decreased the acidsoluble thiol content of the heart for these compounds there was a significant correlation between the decrease in coronary flow and the decrease in thiols we conclude that in the isolated heart most sh reagents if used at the appropriate concentration will increase the HR rate probably by relaasing catecholamines they will also decrease the coronary resistance probably by a direct effect on the coronary vessels,16|64|70|146,hearts|oxidized|heart|heart

nicotine perfused through the coronary circulation of the isolated atropinized cat HR elicits antidromic activity in the cardiac sympathetic nerves the pattern of discharge varies in a complex fashion with dose at low concentrations activity may last up to min whereas at high doses the antidromic response may last only a few seconds sympathetic transmitter is released into the perfusion fluid there is dissociation between the amount of transmitter that overflows from the heart and the total antidromic activity with increasing dose of nicotine with smaller doses of NIC the magnitude of the antidromic activity probably indicates the level of depolarization of the nerve terminal i.t. of greater doses of nicotine causes still greater transmitter release but not the generation of antidromic impulses due presumably to persistent depolarization below a critical level during the NIC infusion and immediately afterwards the antidromic response to acetylcholine and the effector responses associated with the adrenergic transmitter PR by acetylcholine and sympathetic nerve stimulation were blocked the rates of recovery of these responses were similar with a halftime of to min although the antidromic response to kcl was blocked during the nicotine infusion it recovered more rapidly within min the antidromic response to kcl tended to exceed control C2 it is proposed that nicotine causes a prolonged depolarization of the membrane of the adrenergic nerve terminal the site of action of nicotine the basis of its prolonged action and the interrelationship of this depolarization with transmitter release and intracellular uptake are discussed,11|88|105|134|153|204,heart|nicotine|injection|nicotine|release|levels

the effects of ionic alterations on the accumulation distribution and movements of cnicotine in slices from rat brain striatum hypothalamus cortex and cerebellum were studied the uptake of cnicotone is not dependent upon na present in the incubation fluid because a ksubstituted ona solution increased the cnicotine tissue space a trissubstituted ona solution decreased the cnicotine tissue space and a sucrosesubstituted ona solution did not NC the amount of cnicotine taken up when compared to the cnicotine tissue space obtained in a normal incubation solution however all three nafree solutions elicited a sustained decrease in cnicotine efflux the increase in cnicotine space produced in a ksubstituted ona solution was present primarily in the slower component of a twocomponent washout whereas the decrease produced in a trissubstituted ona solution produced an equal percentage decrease in the size of both components most of the observed effects could be attributed to a linear relationship between the logarithm of the intracellular k concentration and the cnicotine tissue space in conclusion it appears that there is an intracellular binding site for nicotine and that the degree of binding is dependent upon the concentration of k,65,change

anesthetized dogs which had been prepared with lumboadrenal vein cannulae were intravenously infused with monoamine axidase alphaeta tryptophan hydroxylase pcpa or tyrosine hydroxylase alphamt inhibitors min prior to exposure to oxygen at ground level these studies were designed to ascertain the role of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine in the adrenocortical response to hypoxia in normoxic animals alphaeta decreased basal cortisol secretion and increased SP whereas pcpa and alphamt were essentially without afffect on these parameters all inhibitors prevented the rise in cortisol secretion usually observed in hypoxic dogs alpha eta appeared to inhibit the adrenocortical response to hypoxia as a result of its potent pressore activity while pcpa and alphamt inhibited cortisol secretion by interfering with the synthesis of serotonin and norepinephrine respictively these data suggest that substances which alter the content andor turnover of brain monoamines abolish the hypoxic rise in cortisol secretion and thus would lower the resistance of the animal to this stressor,64,systolic pressure

the treatment of spinach chloroplasts with pnitrothiophenol in the light at acidic and neutral phs caused TPS inhibition of the photosystem ii activity whereas the same treatment in the dark did not affect the activity at all the photosystem i activity was not inhibited by pnitrothiophenol both in the light and in the dark the inhibition was accompanied by changes of fluorescence from chloroplasts as observed at room temperature the nm band was lowered by the pnitrothiophenol treatment in the light and at liquid nitrogen temperature the relative height of the nm band to the nm band increased and the nm band shifted to longer wavelengths the action spectra for these effects of pnitrothiophenol on the activity and fluorescence showed a peak at nm with a red drop at longer wavelengths it was concluded that the CS absorbed by photosystem ii is responsible for the chemical modification of chloroplasts with pnitrothiopehnol to causing the specific inhibition of PS ii,16|136|157,specific|light|photosystem
