6234238,pyridoxinedependent seizure is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that usually presents with neonatal intractable seizures this syndrome results from an inborn abnormality of the enzyme glu decarboxylase which results in reduced pyridazinedependent synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma amino butyric acid the full range of symptomatology is unknown but can be associated with autism breath holding and SMR bilious vomiting transient visual agnosia severe articulatory apraxia motor dyspraxia microcephaly and intrauterine seizures parenteral pyridine injection test is a highly ERP and reproducible test in confirming the diagnosis pyridoxine should be po as a diagnostic test in all cases of convulsive disorders of infancy in which no other diagnosis is evident epileptic seizure discharges subside within minutes T3 the i.v. of mg of pyridaoxine once the diagnosis is confirmed MT should be continued indefinitely and doses increased with age or intercurrent illnesses the MD of bg needed is still not clear there is a relatively wide range for the daily b dose necessary to control the seizure ie mgday,57,severe mental retardation
3874752,a total of PA isolates were collected from GA hospitals in japan from to of these isolates carbapenemresistant strains were subjected to dna hybridization analysis with the MBL gene blaimpspecific probe fifteen strains carrying the MBL gene were identified in five hospitals in different geographical Az three strains of p aeruginosa demonstrated highlevel imipenem resistance mic or microgramsml two strains exhibited lowlevel imipenem resistance mic or microgramsml and the rest of the strains were in between these results revealed that the acquisition of a MBL gene CT does not necessarily confer elevated resistance to carbapenems in several strains the MBL gene was carried by large plasmids and carbapenem resistance was transferred from p aeruginosa to escherichia coli by electroporation in association with the acquisition of the large plasmid southern hybridization analysis and genomic dna fingerprinting profiles revealed different genetic backgrounds for these isolates although considerable similarity was observed for the strains isolated from the same hospital these findings suggest that the metallobetalactamaseproducing p aeruginosa strains are not confined to a unique clonal lineage but proliferated multifocally by plasmidmediated dissemination of the MBL gene in strains of different genetic backgrounds thus further proliferation of metallobetalactamaseproducing strains with resistance to various betalactams may well be inevitable in the future which emphasizes the need for early recognition of metallobetalactamaseproducing strains rigorous IC and restricted clinical use of broadspectrum betalactams including carbapenems,99,metallobetalactamase

3433289,a compound may be developmentally neurotoxic because it interferes with a metabolic step exclusively or preferentially expressed during OD in a particular class of neural cells the initial metabolic specificity is often complicated by secondary responses in the affected cells involvement of other functionallyrelated cell types and the presence of compensatory andor regenerative responses in this context we study tellurium which systemically blocks cholesterol biosynthesis at the SE step because of the high demand in developing IP nerves for newly synthesized cholesterol required for myelin assembly this metabolic block leads to demyelination of the sciatic nerve this insult is confounded by the fact that the myelinforming SCs do not upregulate their cholesterol biosynthetic pathway this is contrary to expectations CL the main source of cholesterol for many tissues outside the nervous system upregulates synthesis of cholesterol and overcomes the metabolic block the shortage of cholesterol in schwann cells results in an immediate secondary response downregulation of steadystate mrna C2 for specific myelin proteins remyelination occurs after cessation of tellurium exposure this model of primary demyelination allows T0 of schwanncell specific responses during the processes of myelin breakdown and subsequent steps leading to remyelination without the complications of axonal degeneration and regeneration because tellurium specifically blocks the synthesis of a major required membrane component it is also well suited for examining the coordinate control of membrane synthesis and assembly at the genomic level,67,squalene epoxidase

11208971,nmda receptor nrab subunits have pdzbinding domains on their extreme ctermini that are known to interact with the psd family and other pdz proteins we explore the interactions between psd family proteins and the nrab cytoplasmic tails and the consequences of these interactions from the endoplasmic reticulum er through delivery to the synapse in primary rat hippocampal and cortical cultured neurons we find that the nrab cytoplasmic tails cluster very early in the sec pathway and interact serially with sap beginning at the IC and then psd we further establish that colocalization of the distal cterminus of nrb and psd begins at the transgolgi network tgn formation of nrbpsdsap complexes is dependent on the pdz IB domain of nrb subunits but association with sap and psd plays no distinguishable role in cluster preformation or initial targeting to the vicinity of the synapse instead the pdz IB domain plays a role in restricting cellsurface clusters to postsynaptic targets,83,intermediate compartment
4246550,dna polymerase beta is required in mammalian cells for the predominant pathway of BER involving single nucleotide gap filling dna synthesis here we examine the relationship between oxidative stress cellular levels of dna polymerase beta and BER capacity in vitro using mouse monocytes and either wildtype mouse fibroblasts or those deleted of the dna polymerase beta gene treatment with an oxidative stressinducing agent such as hydrogen peroxide morpholinosydnonimine xanthinexanthine oxidase or lipopolysaccharide was found to increase the level of dna polymerase beta in both monocytes and fibroblasts BER capacity in vitro as measured in crude cell extracts was also increased by lipopolysaccharide treatment in both cell types in monocytes lipopolysaccharidemediated upregulation of the BER system correlated with increased resistance to the monofunctional dna alkylating agent MMS by making use of a quantitative pcr CA to detect lesions in genomic dna we show that lipopolysaccharide treatment of FB cells reduces the incidence of spontaneous dna lesions this effect may be due to the enhanced dna polymerase betadependent base excision repair capacity of the cells because a similar decrease in dna lesions was not observed in cells deficient in BER by virtue of dna polymerase beta gene deletion similarly fibroblasts treated with lipopolysaccharide were more resistant to MMS than UT cells this effect was not observed in cells deleted of the dna polymerase beta gene these results suggest that the dna polymerase betadependent base excision repair pathway can be upregulated by oxidative stressinducing agents in mouse cell lines,36,base excision repair

310569,LC is primarily a th century phenomenon its epidemiology is reviewed and the usefulness of epidemiological studies in providing clues to etiology is evaluated internationally lung cancer accounts for up to of all deaths in age CG above years it is a disease characterized by C1 international variations in incidence in addition urbanrural differences occur in many countries malefemale ratios are high to but T3 a rise during the first half of the century these ratios are now declining in a number of countries neither racial CSD nor migrant studies indicate that genetic AF play any important role in the etiology of lung CA the only possible indication of their playing such a role is the high incidence of LC among chinese primarily cantonese women a genetic determination of individual susceptibility has been suggested but racial differences remain to be demonstrated the increase in lung CA that started during the first decades of the th century in europe and north america is consistent with the introduction of a carcinogen into the environment at the turn of the century both spatial and temporal trends of lung CA support the hypothesis that CS is the L1 etiological factor this is further supported by numerous specific investigations of the problem a decrease in LC incidence in certain age groups in a number of countries may reflect changing smoking habits and the diminishing tar content of modern cigarettes thus indicating ways of prevention current knowledge of GA air pollution seems to ascribe it a secondary role as an etiological factor the risk of lung cancer is greater in certain occupations often because of an interaction between industrial air pollution and smoking it may be concluded that LC is largely a problem of modern society and that the epidemiological results are consistent with an etiological role of preventable environmental AF,190,cigarette smoking

3342267,histamine is known to be the neurotransmitter of insect photoreceptors histaminelike immunoreactivity is also found in a number of interneurons in the CNS system of various insects here we demonstrate by immunohistochemical techniques that in drosophila melanogaster acalypterae most or all mechanosensory SN of imaginal hair sensilla selectively bind antibodies directed against histamine the histaminelike staining includes the cell bodies of these SN as well as their axons which form prominent fibre bundles in IP nerves and their terminal projections in the central neuropil of head and thoracic ganglia the specificity of the IS is demonstrated by investigating a drosophila mutant unable to synthesize histamine other mechanosensory organs such as CS or scolopidial organs do not stain in the calypteran flies musca and calliphora we find no comparable immunoreactivity associated with either hair sensilla or the nerves entering the central nervous system observations in agreement with earlier studies on calliphora thus histamine seems to be a L1 mechanosensory transmitter candidate of the AD NS of drosophila but apparently not of musca or calliphora,110,campaniform sensilla

4540686,synapses in the CE nervous system undergo various short and longterm changes in their strength but it is often difficult to distinguish whether presynaptic or postsynaptic mechanisms are responsible for these changes using patchclamp recording from giant synapses in the mouse AEP brainstem we show here that ST synaptic depression can be largely attributed to rapid depletion of a RRP of LDV replenishment of this pool is highly dependent on the recent history of synaptic activity highfrequency stimulation of presynaptic terminals significantly enhances the rate of replenishment broadening the presynaptic action potential with the potassiumchannel blocker tetraethylammonium which increases ca entry further enhances the rate of replenishment as this increase can be suppressed by the cachannel blocker cd or by the ca buffer egta we conclude that ca influx through voltagegated ca channels is the key signal that dynamically regulates the refilling of the releasable pool of synaptic vesicles in response to different patterns of inputs,59,readily releasable pool

1104534,the FP of the embryonic rat spinal cord has been proposed to act as an intermediate target that plays a role in the pattern of extension of commissural axons to begin to examine the role of the FP in axon guidance at the midline we have studied the precision of the commissural axon projection to and across the FP during development to delineate the pathway the fluorescent carbocyanine dye dii has been used as a probe we show that commissural axons traverse the floor plate and turn rostrally at its CL border with remarkable precision axons were not observed to turn ipsilaterally and turned only upon reaching the contralateral edge of the floor plate virtually all commissural axons follow this route the morphology of commissural growth cones was also examined as they encountered the floor SP commissural growth cones became larger and increased in complexity the reorientation of axons in register with the floor SP boundary and the NC in the morphological properties of commissural growth cones as they traverse the midline suggest that the floor SP may act as a guidepost with functions similar to cells that have been implicated in axon guidance in invertebrates,37,floor plate

9177589,severe sexual sadism is a disorder of sexual preference that focuses on humiliation and subjugation of the victim sometimes causing grievous injury or death sexual sadists pose a particular risk however the diagnosis as such is unreliable and prevalence estimates vary in a sample of male highsecurity forensic inpatients who had committed sexual offenses we found twothirds of sexual sadists had not been identified as such prior to commitment possible reasons for missing the diagnosis are many fold present data support the notion that unrecognized sexual sadists more closely resembled nonsadistic sex offenders than accurately diagnosed sadists in particular initially unrecognized sexual sadists had less severe previous convictions less VT and experienced a less supportive upbringing than their correctly identified sadistic counterparts the latter in contrast more often reached media coverage through their offenses we conclude that severe sexual sadism is likely an underdiagnosed yet forensically highly relevant disorder,109,vocational training

7657941,the cutaneous lymphatic system plays an important role in the maintenance of tissue fluid homeostasis in the afferent phase of the immune response and in the M1 spread of skin cancers however the lymphatic system has not received as much scientific attention as the blood vascular system largely due to a lack of lymphaticspecific markers and to the dearth of knowledge about the molecular regulation of its OD and CF the recent ID of genes that specifically control lymphatic development and the growth of lymphatic vessels lymphangiogenesis together with the discovery of new lymphatic endotheliumspecific markers have now provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms that control lymphatic growth and function moreover studies of several genetic mouse models have set the framework for a new molecular model for embryonic lymphatic vascular OD and have identified molecular pathways whose mutational inactivation leads to human diseases associated with LE these scientific advances have also provided surprising evidence that malignant tumors can directly promote lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis and that lymphatic vessels play a major role in cutaneous inflammation and in the cutaneous response to uvb irradiation,146,lymphedema

1316993,several laboratories have reported that nali countertransport MICs are increased in red blood cells from HT it has been proposed that the activity of this red blood cell transport system might reflect the activity of a similar system in V1 smooth muscle we previously demonstrated nali exchange in sarcolemmal LDV from canine artery and proposed that this transport CF might be mediated by the nah exchanger in the present studies however we were unable to demonstrate nali countertransport in canine red blood cells since bovine red blood cells have a vigorous nali exchanger and we previously demonstrated nah exchange in sarcolemmal LDV from bovine i.a. we wished to determine whether bovine sarcolemmal LDV mediate nali exchange and whether this transport CF is mediated via the nah exchanger we found that an outwardly directed proton or li gradient stimulated na uptake in sarcolemmal LDV from bovine SMA artery li gradientstimulated na uptake was not due to electrical coupling between the two ions was not affected by a NC in membrane potential and could not be explained by the parallel operation of lih and nah exchange external li inhibited proton gradientstimulated na uptake and external protons inhibited li gradientstimulated na uptake na efflux from LDV was stimulated by inwardly directed gradients for li or protons and these effects were not additive proton efflux from vesicles was stimulated by inwardly directed gradients for na or li and these effects were not additive finally nah exchange and nali exchange in sarcolemmal vesicles were inhibited by nethylnisopropylamiloride in an MZ dosedependent manner in conclusion nali CT could not be demonstrated in canine red blood cells but as is the case with bovine red blood cells sarcolemmal LDV from bovine artery mediate nali CT this transport CF and sarcolemmal nah exchange are mediated via a single nethylnisopropylamiloridesensitive cation exchanger with affinity for na li and protons the cow as opposed to the dog may be a good animal MM to test whether the activity of red blood cell nali CT is predictive of the activity of nali and nah exchange in V1 smooth muscle,260,countertransport

1001051,a subset of heat shock proteins hsp alpha hsp beta and a member of the hsp family hsc shows enhanced synthesis following mitogenic activation as well as heat shock in human peripheral blood MNC cells in this T0 we have examined expression of mrna for these proteins including the major kda heat shock protein hsp in MNC cells following either heat shock or mitogenic activation with phytohemagglutinin pha ionomycin and the PDBu TPA the results demonstrate that the kinetics of mrna expression of these four genes generally parallel the kinetics of enhanced protein synthesis seen following either heat shock or mitogen activation and provide clear evidence that mitogeninduced synthesis of hsc and hsp is due to increased mrna C2 and not simply to enhanced translation of preexisting mrna although most previous studies have focused on Tc regulation of hsp mrna we found that hsp mrna was only slightly and transiently induced by pha activation while hsc is the predominant kda heat shock protein homologue induced by mitogens similarly hsp alpha appears more inducible by heat shock than mitogens while the opposite is true for hsp beta these results suggest that although hsp and hsc have been shown to contain similar promoter regions additional regulatory mechanisms which result in differential expression to a given stimulus must exist they clearly demonstrate that HL are an important MM system for determining mechanisms for regulation of heat shock protein synthesis in unstressed cells finally based on kinetics of mrna expression the results are consistent with the hypothesis that hsc and hsp mRNA are driven by an ilil receptordependent pathway in human TA,220,human lymphocytes

7576974,APDs work for patients only when given repeatedly the overall temporal DP of symptom improvement is not clear some recent data question the traditional delayedonset hypothesis and suggest that the onset of AP response may be relatively early and the improvement may grow with repeated treatment the present T0 systematically examined the time course of the antipsychotic effect and the underlying behavioral mechanisms using a CS avoidance response car MM rats repeatedly treated with either typical haloperidol or atypical olanzapine risperidone antipsychotics but not anxiolytics chlordiazepoxide show an earlyonset progressive acrosssession decline in avoidance responding which reemerges when the treatment is stopped this effect is dosedependent transferable between antipsychotics and cannot be attributed to simple sedation or motor side effects furthermore we found that the DP of this druginduced decline depends on the number of exposures to the conditioned CS- in the presence of the drug and is best understood as the result of druginduced attenuation of the reinforcing effectiveness of the conditioned stimulus we also found that repeated AUC can create a drug interoceptive state that allows the attenuated reinforcing property of the CS- to be maintained over time together these data provide preclinical support for the newly postulated earlyonset hypothesis and suggest that the repeated AP car model may be useful for understanding the neurochemical and behavioral mechanisms underlying the clinical effects of antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia,32,antipsychotic
